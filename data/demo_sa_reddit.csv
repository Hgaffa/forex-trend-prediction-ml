204,2011-11-15,About to start trading for the first time. Anyone wanna talk?,"I don't really have any specific questions, just looking for general advice.  Well, maybe one...see the bottom.

I've gone through most of the babypips school, and just finished reading [Courtney Smith's book](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Living-Trading-Foreign-Exchange/dp/0470442298/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1321390023&sr=8-4).  

I have somewhat of a bit of background in game theory due to hobbies (I was one of the better players in the country in the national tournament scene of a certain video game, and have close friends who have been ranked in chess and poker who I have been playing with and learned a lot of game theory from), and tend to prefer boring, ""turtle"" strategies.

I considered scalping, but I don't think it will fit my lifestyle (time consuming).  So, I'm probably going to look at position trading the daily charts, and I'll start mostly with the methods from the book I was reading.  I want to be as disciplined as possible- picking entry/exit points before entering the trade, doing as much of it automatically via stops as possible (which I will look at and adjust only according to TA), and looking at my positions once per day.  No emotion.

On a long flight yesterday I finally sat down and wrote up a trading plan, buying on a few techniques, all of which have set stops.

I'll calculate my position size so that if I am stopped out (stops based on technical analysis) I will lose 1% of my account value.  This also means that positions with wide stops will not be very profitable.

I will write down every trade and what signal I used to make the trade.  Every thirty trades, I'll eliminate my worst-performing signal and replace it with a different one, and see how I do.

I did some backtesting on EUR/USD over the first few months of 2009.  Trading on inside days seemed profitable, as well as reversal days.  Channel breakouts were iffy...I used the ADX filter to exit, and that let me exit at really good times, but because the stops were too wide (for long position, I was buying at 55 day high breakout and setting stop to 20-day low breakout) I was barely making any money off of it and that was wiped out by the bad trades.  I need to figure out where I can place tighter stops on Channel Breakouts without removing too many winning trades.  My biggest concern is that inside days seemed *too* consistent...I usually made almost as much money as I was risking on my stop every time I did it, barring one or two times where I basically broke even.  Seems like a couple losing trades could've set me back pretty quickly and I should be seeing more.

I should probably do more backtesting, but I feel a trial by fire would work better.  I'll probably just set the risk to 0.5% instead of 1% and start a very small account and see how it does (I'd have to lose hundreds of trades in a row to get wiped out).


Am I doing this right?


**And, the real question- what broker should I use?**

Right now I'm looking at Oanda.  I saw a poster saying good things about IB and I'd rather use Ninjatrader because I hate MT 4, so I might look at shifting over to them when I have more money, but I don't have $25k liquid cash available to open an account with them.  Oanda's flexibility with position size seems ideal for my ~1% risk on stop plan.

However, the more I read about Forex brokers, the more nervous I get...they seem to make money when you lose and engage in all kinds of unscrupulous tactics like stop-hunting, slippage failing to trigger stops, and raising the spreads during big moves.  Feels more like playing against the house than trading.  This alone makes me feel tempted to go trade stock options instead with the same plan and see if that works. Thoughts?",6,0.81

Yesterday the trade was obviously cold and the market fluctuated with the fundamental. Italy senate yesterday got through the confidence vote on austerity package, that is, the new authority won by overwhelming advantages 257 VS 41, which cleared the way for the force of 20.0 billion Euros austerity package. Yesterday the UK released his Q3 GDP final value, line with the expected level, and the US Q3 GDP final value were worse than expected level, 1.8% lower than 2.0%-expectation. And the US December Umich CCI final value-69.9 was higher than expectation-68.0. The US data generally is delaying the better-tiding tone. 
Today is the last trade day before the Christmas, but is the birthday of emperor of Japan, whereas the session is closed. And New Zealand closes the session in advance. So the market trade is further shrinking. Fundamental is short for the stimulus of economy data. Forex traders should be wary of trading. 
USD INDEX: yesterday index fluctuated with data and shot up 80.08, remaining consolidating in 79.60—80.08. Today the index may continue the consolidating.

Ultimately, USD/JPY increased by almost one thousand pips. On the chart we will look formation of the fourth wave by Elliott.

412,2013-01-20,"Experienced Traders: help me put my early results in perspective, please?","I'm up almost 20% in one week, without ever risking more than 5-6% of my account balance on any single trade. I'm sure this is unsustainable, but is it possible I could average 5%/week over time?

Background: I have spent much of the last decade playing poker professionally, so I am way more experienced with short-term, high pressure, real-time investment decisions than the average n00b forex trader. I read a book on forex and opened a practice account, which I traded successfully for a month before going live. 

The strategy i developed is pretty simple:

-I started with $500 and only trade 10k lots. My plan is to move up to 20k lots when (if?) I hit $1k, 30k lots at $1500 etc.

-I only trade the EUR/USD.

-I hold positions for anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.

-When eur/usd is moving back and forth within a fairly narrow trading range (10-15 pips), I wait for it to approach the top or bottom of the range and then jump in to catch the rebound.

-If I am right, I cash out quickly and take my 3-5 pips and then wait for the next set-up.

-If I am wrong and find myself sitting between 5 and 10 pips in the negative, I consult longer timeframe charts to decide whether to kill the trade and cut my losses, or risk another 10-15 pips if I think I just entered too soon and will get it back on the rebound.

-If I do choose to hold on once I'm down 10 pips, I cash out as soon as a spike in the right direction gets me even on that trade or just slightly ahead. Sometimes I'll cash out a few pips down if it looks like my rebound is petering out and down a few pips is as close Im gonna get for that trade.

-If I hold on and it keeps moving against me, I cut my losses at 20-25 pips. At that point the premise of my set-up (that we're range-bound) is no longer valid.

-I steadfastly resist the temptation to add a second 10k to a losing position in an attempt to dollar cost average my way back out of the hole (this was the move that got me in trouble my first week of practice trading)

-I close out any short-term positions as the hour when Tokyo, New York, or London begins trading approaches, since this often leads to bigger swings that I cannot predict without better fundmanetals.

-When the market is not moving in a predictable range, I sit out and wait for it to either settle (at which point I start short-term scalping again), or make a big move in one direction. 

-When it swings big (30 pips+ in less than an hour, 80 pips+ over a few hours) I wait for the breakout to stall, then jump in to try and catch the rebound. I'll set a limit at around 50% retracement(basically a fibonacci target with a substantial margin of error). I'll set my stop loss at around 30 pips, generally aiming about 5 pips beyond where the charts show the next big resistance level to be located. I'm willing to risk a few extra pips to decrease the chances that I will get stopped out on a spike that tests just at or just beyond the likely resistance point before failing.

I can easily spot a big potential flaw in my approach: my losses are 2-4x the size of my wins, forcing me to be right a big % of the time to stay profitable. Just 2-3 blown trades in a row will eat all the profit of a bunch of wins. That said, I've had 51 winners averaging 4.5 pips against 11 losers averaging 11.4 pips, since I started trading real money. These figures are only slightly better than my averages over 250 practice trades.

I strongly suspect that I am running over variance, and I can easily compute that if I flip only one trade each day from winner to loser, I finish the week up 25 pips instead of 100. But even that average would make me rich in a couple years. Frankly, picking off five pips a day seems way easier than beating poker games.

What am I missing??

418,2013-01-27,Fundamental Analysis: Week 27 January 2 February 2013 Event Calendar,"As I have hinted markets continued to trend last week. This week could be a break from these trends to gather more strength. So don't be surprised if it ranges most of the time. Trends do not go from point A to B in one straight line. Don't forget there will be corrections. USD events will dominate the market, other than that there are no red flags data wise. Volatility will begin slow and it will increase through the middle of the week.


For USD pairs week will begin first with the indicators hinting health of the current economy. Core Durable Goods Orders, although not very reliable shows what will be the production figures in the future. More orders is good for the economy. Expectation is positive but an extreme number is not expected. Pending Home Sales, which is an another leading indicator for the existing home sales will also be released. An increase is expected which is a good sign. Surveys show the amount of foreclosures are declining. US housing market is showing signs of recovery. Federal Reserve rate decision will be announced but more important part is the FOMC statement. Nobody expects a rate change yet. Statements hinting the future decisions are more crucial. Non-Farm Employment Change and unemployment figures will close the week on Friday. Employment is a very important figure for the current state of the economy. A small increase in NFP and a unemployment rate under 8% again will not be a surprise. By looking at the overall expectations through-out the week one can say a stronger USD should be expected.

423,2013-02-03,Fundamental Analysis: Week 3 - 9 February 2013 Event Calendar,"Last week I was expecting a profit realization and a correction for future Euro strength. However market played the other way. There is a huge pressure to reach around 1.4 psychological level. I still believe a correction is needed to reach those figures. Yet it will not surprise me to see an another push through the 1.40 before ECB press conference. Last week expectations hinted a stronger USD, but the real numbers failed to fulfill these expectations. This week events are more focused towards Euro. We have also GBP rate decision, which is another red flag to look into.

USD event calendar for this week is not very crowded. We have Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) to be released. Expectation is around 55. As long as it is over 50 it is regarded as good. However if it comes like expected it means there is a decline from the previous 56.1 which could cause a negative reaction. It is an indicator coming from the biggest job suppliers so do not underestimate this one. Trade Balance will also be announced this week. An improved balance is expected which is good for USD.

This week’s events will very likely provide the necessary encouragements for volatility on the EUR/USD. Last week’s price action tells us that traders wanted more than a few estimate misses, they want to see a real shift, even if mostly symbolic, of policy stance. The Euro Unemployment and Markit PMI will serve well to prepare market participants for the rate decision due later this week. The consensus is to expect a 25bp cut to 0.5%. Other event risks to watch for from Greece, Cyprus, and Spain. First up, EU is scheduled to decide on Monday on the next tranche of aid for Greece, with the condition that Greece will accept another round of austerity. The Cypriot parliament will also vote on Tuesday whether to accept the bailout from EU and the associated harsh conditions. Spain Q1 GDP is also due, although one might argue that the effects will be minimal since their recent downgrade.

The pair was in a narrow down-range last week, twice failing to break the 1.3100 level. Current price levels also presents a misalignment of price versus the negative expectations, in other words, the pair is artificially inflated above the 1.30 levels. Therefore, holding a short bias for this pair this week will likely yield a higher r/r if the fundamentals line up.
  
**What I Seek**
Below are notable issues that I want to see. Failure of either will cause me to exit or hedge my trades.

EUR
The pair is now ambivalent towards minute economic data/events, so I would only pay attention to major ones:
  
* 30 Apr: Euro Unemployment is expected to remain at 12% – I expect to see a miss
* 01 May: Market PMI overall is expected to show a slight decrease – I look for the decrease to be met
* Is there a cloud of negativity to the conditions of the bailout, or is there an expectation of a Cyrpus exit – No longer news, will have to see how price reacts
* Will tensions in Greece allow for another round of austerity and hence the aid – Very subjective reactions but more can agree with bitter medicine  
  

USD
The dollar has been the better child, I wouldn’t need to ask for much just that it remains neutral:

* 03 May: NFP – the abysmal 88k we saw last month leaves much room for improvement. As long as figures DO NOT cross below 88k
* 03 May: Unemployment – Remain the same or better
* 03 May: PMI – Consense of -0.3 or better
  
**Update:Apr 30--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Positive news from European banking sector showing high margins from Q1 investment banking activity, lowering expectations of a rate cut, and hopes of ECB President Mario Draghi to deliver (as usual), is helping the EUR edge higher. We see from price action that the markets really favor buying EUR/USD, with higher up moves than down moves.

The USD weakness. It appears that the failure to print higher/nearer inflation at the 2% target, drop in Chicago PMI is prompting a slight shift in bias from 'possibly winding down QE' to 'possibly maintain'.

Risk to downside should be noted. Once again, watch for the 50% fib level. I still prefer shorts because of potentially higher r/r now that we are nearing 1.32. Good stop above 1.32

**Positives:**

* Draghi Effect
* rate cut already priced in
* Expectation of dovish Fed to maintain QE instead of slowing due to GDP miss, inflation < 2%, PMI miss.
  
**Negatives:**

* Poor data
* Low inflation
* Expectation of Draghi to deliver 

**Update: May 02-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

The ECB is not introducing additional measures yet, but stressed continuance of current measures. It however mentions using ABS as a tool. The expectation of something more has somewhat been missed.
Meanwhile, US Initial/Continuing Jobless Claim is expected to deteriorate, but has beat expectations by improving instead.

1.3230 Holds, downward bias stronger. Next respectable support ~1.3055

I expected price to retest 1.5250, but we never got there. I didn’t place breakout orders, because I knew that there would be significant volatility on just about any GDP number, and I didn’t want to be the chump on the wrong end of a news fade.
  
  
**Now We’re Here**

I left the lines on: **http://i.imgur.com/NjgqVvy.png**
   
Through the 38. fib at the important 1.5400 level without even stopping for gas, on the back of not being in a triple dip recession. Looking at the 15 minute candles, this looks like an honest-to-goodness news breakout. 1.5200 to 1.5300 was a serious chop zone, with fairly large moves but little direction.
  
Technically this pair has been a nightmare, but in hindsight the move looks completely logical. That leaves me with no other choice but to…
  
  
**Talk About Fundamentals!**

Price action represents the difference in confidence between those who believe a currency is cheap versus those who believe it is expensive. Those opinions are informed by perceived supply and demand information, which is mostly provided by the news. One way to look at it, and the way I prefer, is that the levels are dictated by technical factors. The market doesn’t know 1.54 is important. The traders watching their charts do, because they use technical analysis. But the movements between them are caused by local and world events, in the context of risk sentiment (in the case of risk-based pairs).

So how is the fundamental UK picture? Still kind of shitty, if you ask me. And I should know, because I’m your average man on the London street. Most people still struggle to get to the end of the month, never mind save money. Retailers just aren’t doing that well, banks still aren’t lending and high street shops are still closing. But it’s not all bad news. In fact, if you look at the chart above I’d say it’s less bad news than good news, but the mix is still very rich.

Most importantly, there is clearly confusion and uncertainty about the state of the economy, from the financial media to the guy who sells me smokes. Opinions differ wildly on whether austerity is working, if the economy is improving, and whether George Osborne is a strong-willed visionary or just a massive knob.
  
Let’s look back to last Friday. Cable had climbed steadily since Thursday, reaching 1.5368, which wasn’t really a very significant place to stop. Price action gave no clues as to what would happen next, but it gave back every pip and more over the last few hours of trading, back to range lows around 1.52. Another downgrade. Nobody was really shocked, but longs were nervous enough to bail.
  
1.52 held, which was significant – the market was waiting for another reason to move. 1.5200 to 1.5300 was then the scene of a week-long battle, and a breakout was coming. I should have seen it, but hindsight is 20/20.
  
  

**How to Trade GBP/USD This Week**

We’ve seen significant gains but slowing momentum into the end of the last trading session – just some light profit taking and offers around 1.55. Mine was one of them, and it was hit by 1/10th of a pip. We didn’t see much retracement though, so I moved my stop to breakeven before the close.
  
Lydia Finkley (and if you trade Sterling, you need to follow this lady: @faithmight) thinks it looks toppy. I’m inclined to agree, and the risk/reward ratio is there for a small short, provided we don’t gap significantly lower on Monday open. However, shorts might not be good for much further than 1.5425, because we still have a bit of channel left to go to the upside. If we get down here and fail to break through quickly, it would be prudent to take profits.
  
If you’re bullish, you’ve missed the boat by now – at least until the next channel swing. There’s no low-risk swing trade entry unless you’re convinced we’re going back up to 1.600. A break of the upward channel could signal very strong buying pressure, but we would then be in an accelerated uptrend. This would give the bears even more reason to climb in. Consider the following:
  
**Reasons to be Bearish**

* The FTSE100 is still at highs. US Stocks are over performing, so much so that they’re getting mainstream media attention.
* Yields aren’t really attractive enough to protect the Pound if risk sentiment turns sour
* We get at least one or two bad news announcements a week concerning the Pound, and the reactions to these are often severe
* Inflation is still the elephant in the room
* Europe is still an economic suck hole
  
**Reasons to be Bullish**

* 1.5200 held like a champ, even after another downgrade
* We’re not in a recession again
* Retail sales and a few numbers have been kind of good lately, and nobody big has gone out of business or needed a bailout since Jessops
* Big green candles!
The picture is mixed – make no mistake. Price action will continue to reflect this. Which is why we’re in a choppy upward channel – there’s slightly more good news than bad news but confidence is still low and gains are hard-fought. Bear this in mind.

**Levels to Watch:**
  
1.55 - where we are now more or less. If the move lacks conviction, this could be the end of the current channel swing. However, a break above targets…
1.558 - only 100 pips from where we closed on Friday, but a big level. Confluence of channel resistance and the 50% fib. If ever there was a place for bears to short, this is it, and you can be sure there will be plenty of offers in this zone. A good place for a stop would be about 1.5670, simply because it’s a previous pivot. If we break this level convincingly and hold above 1.54, this channel is no longer a corrective counter-trend move.
1.54 - remember that a break below here could still struggle to gain traction, as we have a lot of near-term supports below. Sideways price action to channel support could be how it plays out, so be wary of shorting a break. Just look how the EUR/USD and AUD/USD have hugged 1.300 and 1.030 respectively this week)
1.5250 - If we get here before the end of the week, something has gone badly wrong for the pound. It will shatter the hopes of bulls, and it will be difficult to regain the lost ground. Further losses are likely, in my opinion. However, given the nature of news-driven price action, it might not be a straightforward trade. Sell the bounce.
  
  
**Last Thoughts**
  
I just want to leave you with one more chart **http://i.imgur.com/9M6FTjm.png** – a daily showing Ichimoku. If you don’t know Ichimoku, check out Tyler Yell’s excellent video on how to use it to identify high probability long term trades.
  
To an Ichimoku trader, this chart is crying out for us to have patience. Price is currently supported by the Kijun-Sen, but is deep inside a bearish cloud. We’ve got a long way to go to either side before a buy or sell signal is issued (in a nutshell we would buy when price is above both the cloud and the orange and blue lines, the cloud is blue, and the yellow line has nothing above it). The cloud ahead is turning bullish, and the Tenkan-Sen (fast MA) has crossed the Kijun-Sen (slow MA). But the Chinkou-span is below the cloud, price is below the cloud, and even if it breaks above there is still uncertainty as to whether it will stay there.
  
The takeaway here is that if you’re trading this pair there are two ways to go about it: One is to try and stay nimble – trade the intraday range swings, which may or may not play out. Be prepared to exit quickly, and seek only low-risk entries. Take profits when you can, don’t try and ride out drawdown, and exit losing positions quickly. The other is to wait and see if a stronger trend will develop.  If it does, my money will be on the downside.

444,2013-04-28,AUD/USD Weekly Outlook (29 April),"**AUD/USD Weekly Outlook 29 April**

The rhetoric for AUD/USD is to expect a rate cut from the RBA due to the disappointing economic data shown over the past weeks from both Australia and China, a major trade partner. This week’s data is likely to reinforce the rhetoric and edge the pair slightly lower. However, the pair has already declined over 300 pips in the past 2 weeks and is nearing the bottom of a significant channel and is showing some oversold conditions.

  
**Technicals  http://i.imgur.com/LkcaejD.jpg**


Going into this week, if data reinforces the rhetoric, then it is straightforward to expect a fall to the bottom of the channel, a good profit target. As usual, watch for major horizontal price levels which usually draws profit taking and option barriers.

However, if the data shows a positive surprise, expect a jump towards the pink MA as 1st resistance as traders start to lower their rate cut expectations. A 2nd resistance would be the 1.0400 level, which is also a 50% fib level from the recent fall.

 

**Trade Setup**
  

Current Position – I am already in a short position from 1.05125 and my target is currently near the bottom of the channel at 1.02010. The HSBC Flash Manufacturing PMI will be key for me to decide a hold or exit. A positive figure is likely to edge the pair higher further into the week and I would look to exit immediately rather than later. My subsequent follow up leading to RBA rate decision in 2 weeks time would then be to place OCO stop-entry orders in both directions with tight stops and targets at respective major price levels. The rational is to take advantage of the anticipated volatility. Also, for the reason that 1 week of positive surprises would not simply alleviate the accumulated pressures of a rate cut, therefore even if data surprises to the upside, we should not assume that the rhetoric is over.
  

New positions – Due to the pair potentially swinging around, a high r/r trade would naturally be with a long bias. Should this week’s data surprise to the upside, I would seek to enter long with a 1st target just below 1.4000, a strong flip level.
  

Either direction is a worthy trade, as long as the r/r is good with tight stops and wide targets. The fundamentals and expectations supports a negative bias, whereas the technicals might argue for a positive. The next two weeks will test the mettle of a trader on this pair. Position well my friends.

  

**Update May 02------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

This pair appears to have played out as expected, edging higher, missing the 1.400, then returning to the rhetoric once data reaffirms it. The price index tomorrow will play a big role. The current price level of ~1.203 is the price of expected rate cuts and a generally poorer economy than one might believe.

Markets were very hopeful, but we saw yesterday that a single reaffirmation of data sparked a sell off in the pair, erasing gains that were built up over last 2 weeks. Tomorrow's PMI and PPI for China and Australia will confirm next week's expectations, and I would expect a sharp fall only if data turns out MORE negative than expected. US NFP and Unemployment might also be set up to impress. Lets take a look:
  
**Upside**
* China Non-manufacturing PMI expected to decline, could surprise.
* Lower yielding EURO might bring activity into AUD.

  
**Downside**
* Australia PPI expected to be higher, could disappoint
* Surprising US Claims data could did not move this pair at all. Potential is there.
* NFPs expected to largely improve. Due to the low 88k last month, it is easy to print improving figures. This could trigger the potential drop.

445,2013-04-29,How to Trade the possible EUR/AUD Breakout,"**EDIT: I put a follow up in the comments below.**

Risk trades have been heavily bid in the first session of the week, with EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD and NZD/USD all performing well. The dollar has been broadly offered, especially against the Swiss Franc, which remained in demand (EUR/CHF is actually down on the day).

When there are broad risk trends in play, EUR/AUD doesn't do much. When there's something that specifically affects either the commodity currencies or the Eurozone, it can move like a freight train.

Here's the 4hr chart showing the recent channel. Let's call it a bull flag, not to say the break will necessarily be to the upside.

http://i.imgur.com/x9ghhF5.png

The chop range is pretty much 1.2600 - 1.2700, so and this is a big range for this pair, so patience is required. You could play it inside the channel, but this is risky considering that one of the swings is likely to turn into a break sooner or later.  Let's take a quick look at the bigger picture before discussing strategy.

**Daily chart:**

http://i.imgur.com/SoNOa5v.png

I really like how this pair respects Fibonacci levels. It can be frustrating to trade short term, but it rewards long term patience and confidence in your strategy and the signals you're seeing.

I also like how my moving averages have crossed. They might not be the best to use for this pair, but momentum is clearly to the upside. That said, a break below the current formation (notice how small and insignificant it is on the daily), would most likely cause them to cross to the downside again. I'd like that very much.

However, the trend is your friend, and we've had these signals so far:

* Double bottom at the 0.816 fib (bullish)
* Break of the 0.38 fib (bullish)
* Bull flag (you get the idea)
* False break above channel (bearish)

**Fundamentals**


Very briefly, trading this pair means you need to think about whether the Euro will go up or down, and whether the Aussie will go up or down. The Aussie is linked to gold and China, both of which are slightly shaky right now.  I'm fundamentally a long term Euro bear, but we all know how it can charge on a bull run simply on the absence of bad news. 

The big mover here is likely to be Thursday's ECB rate decision, but I don't know if this pair will wait that long. There's a raft of European, Australian and Chinese data on the cards (check out our handy economic calendar), so expect volatility and don't be fooled by velocity inside the range!

**How to Trade a EUR/AUD Breakout**


A breakout is probably how this will play out, but nothing is certain.

**A break to the upside** could find resistance everywhere from **1.270 - 1.2800**, so be careful here. Once we're clear of that fib, it might be a rocky road but we'll probably end up at 1.29 fairly shortly. Remember this probably means that the Aussie has given up its rallying at around 1.04 and started falling sharply.

**A break to the downside** is more challenging (reversal breaks naturally have more recently formed support/resistance levels and can be choppy). Personally I would like to see a break of not only the channel, but the whole 1.2600 area where the 0.38 fib lives. This will mean that the Aussie is climbing rapidly, or some kind of new Eurozone mini-crisis or some really bad data has emerged

There are a couple of different strategies we can employ. Bear in mind these are both medium term trades that will **probably take a few days if not a week or two to play out**, and there will be some drawdown if you hold them.

**1. Breakout OCO Orders**

This is the most risky way to play it as far as I'm concerned, because the possibility of a false break is high. To do this you would simply place a buy order above the range and a sell order below. Some people like to use 10% daily ATR as a buffer as well. Stops could go on the other side of the channel, but I would put them about 23-35 pips below/above the channel edges, to take us out of a false breakout trade.

**2. Wait for the break, trade the retracement**

When price is moving strongly in one direction, it's tempting to jump in.  But price seldom moves in a straight line, so you have to remind yourself that you'll probably get a better price if you wait. It might keep you out of a trade, but as you learn more you'll begin to recognize when you can just jump in and when you should wait for the pullback/bounce. This will probably be one of those times.

**To the upside** I'd like to see a break to the **1.2750 area**, and then a move back to channel resistance-turned-support. We might not get all the way back here, so go in when you see a pullback. A good way to do this is to draw a fib on the hourly candle of the break, and then look for bounces down to the .50 and 0.23 fibs. If it keeps crashing through these levels, it might be a false break. 1.2900 looks like a good conservative target, but we might see 1.300

**To the Downside** we'll almost certainly get support at the fib level below 1.2600, and then again at 1.2530-1.2500 where there's a big conflict of supply and demand. Look for a bounce in this area to retest the fib level, and then sell. 1.2400 and 1.2300 are good targets.

**A good place for a stop** would be a bit of the way into the channel. This will stop us out on a false break and return to the channel. Don't set it too close, or you could be stopped out by the rally you're trying to sell!

There's no guarantee you'll get either of these entries if a break does happen, but they're the most low-risk entries and that's really what it's all about, isn't it?

**One More Thing**

If we do get that break to the downside, and we get back to 1.2250, we will then be looking at a year-long **complex head-and-shoulders pattern, with a head height of around 900 pips**. That targets 1.125 if the neckline is broken. Just saying.",11,0.88

After Mario Draghi suggested yesterday that the EU could see negative deposit rates in the future the Euro slam dunked down to around the 1.3060 mark and consolidated there during the night. I expected this, and i expected this to continue mostly up until non farm payrolls today. However, there are strong rumours that the number has been leaked to many financial institutions which changes how i will attempt to play this. 

I believe that with the revisions down to the data after the ADP miss, The NFP data will be very close to the estimate. This will cause the EUR to enter a downtrend against the USD as the forecasted data should already be priced in to the market. Therefore i will be looking for opportunities this morning to short the EUR in preparation for the data.

**TRADE DIARY**

10am Gmt - The EUR/USD is moving bullishly this morning, passing the 1.3100 mark and heading upwards. Taking a look at the volume and the ticks, i can see that there is heavy buying on the dips of this upward trend with less volume on the retractions. This tells me that it is possible that hedge funds or other players could be buying on the dips in an attempt to position themselves for bad data. This will not change my view, unless we pass the 1.3150 mark following this trend. Then i will have reasonable suspicions that major players are positioned for Bearish data. 

10.35am GMT - Uptrend looks pretty solid, looking for an entry point for a low leverage long, to pick up some pennies if i cannot find a setup for my short trade. 

11am GMT - Abandoned my quest for a long, no entry point. Watch and wait. 

12.15pm GMT - Long back on the table, looking for entry point at the pivot. Waiting. 

12.21pm GMT - Entered low leverage long position

12.28pm GMT - Seeing very very big long positions coming in. May be a sign of things to come?

12.41pm GMT - http://www.forexlive.com/blog/2013/05/03/euro-rallies-as-nowotny-tries-to-play-down-ecb-depo-rate-comments/ could be the reason that the euro is rallying? I personally doubt it. 

12.45pm GMT - Dropped 33 pips in about 15 seconds. ECB contradicting themselves again. Didnt hit my stop loss, sticking with my long. ECB is just noise.

12.51pm GMT - Exited my long, lost 12 pips on low leverage. Getting confused now, the price action is messed up with the ECB talking aswell. Watch and Wait. 

12.55pm GMT - Big long positions coming in. Seriously think hedge funds are positioning for bad data. Looking for another long, exiting my previous one was a mistake. 

13.07pm GMT - Unsure if i will get my long position in. Totally abandoned my quest for a short, price action just does not feel right. If i have missed the opportunity i will not trade. However the PA is showing significant interest in negative data. 

13.14pm GMT - Found entry on a long. Watch and Wait. 

13.25pm GMT - Lots of big longs coming in. Looking good.

Meanwhile Spain’s services sector shrank for the 21st month reaching 45.3 in March, up slightly from 44.7 in February and beating forecast for a reading of 44.3. Euro-zone service sector purchasing managers’ index fell to 46.4 from 47.9 in February, the lowest since October last year. These weak figures indicate the Eurozone still bearish. Spanish service sector is expected to improve to 45.8, but the Eurozone service sector is expected to remain at 46.6. 

* French Industrial Production (est: -0.2%): Tuesday, 7:45. French industrial output increased more than expected in February, rising 0.7% after an upwardly revised 0.8% in the previous month, amid increased production in car and aircraft factories.

Exports declined 1.5% on the month, the first drop since while. Imports fell a sharper 3.8% on the month and are now down 0.9% on 4Q since the start of the year. The unstable export situation means Germany’s own recovery from a weak 4Q remains a bumpy ride.

Someone asked a while back to post about my own retail trading methods.  I took inspiration from James Simon and tried to utilize my math background.  Essentially, I worked under a multi asset macro model approach to trading.  This was back in 07-09ish and I heavily relied on multiple asset pricing. Greek Deutsche CDS spread differentials, 10y tbill-10y boj yield differential, aud/usd-5y boj.  I worked a lot with MatLab and stochastic processes in previous research with a professor so I utilized a lot of the methods I learned from her (mann-kendall, karatzas, and modified push tests were big ones).

A few questions for seasoned technical analysts...   
1. a lot of descriptions of patterns discuss ""new high"" or ""new low"" as indicators. What, in your opinion is the length of time from prior higs/lows before you consider something a ""new high"" or ""new low""?   
2. Related to #1. Double bottoms (and tops) are described as classic reversal patterns. How far apart do you think the double should be to be a ""true"" double? The example [here](http://imgur.com/kVchdMS) shows a 15 minute chart of the USD/JPY from today (I put it into line mode to keep it easy on the eyes).

463,2013-05-08,3 very bearish points on the AUD,"Three reasons why I wouldn't be buying the dip in AUD/USD down here and instead looking for a break lower: 

---

1. Level of rate differentials finally approaching trigger levels 
AUD has remained remarkably resilient to the contraction in rate differentials versus the rest of the world. The chart below shows that this is not that surprising however. AUD/USD is historically far more sensitive to the level of rates rather than direction, with 100bps serving as the ""magic number"".  Excluding 2008, the last three big break-outs in AUD/USD were preceded by a crossing of this threshold. Fixed income inflows have already slowed down to close to zero, with central bank buying largely reflecting a rotation, rather than increase in foreign bond ownership. With AU-US rate differentials at around 130bps, another 30bps rise in US yields may be the final trigger needed to see a more substantial unwind of the Aussie fixed income inflow boom. 

[Pretty pictures](http://i.imgur.com/BZymeLE.gif)

2. The mining peak is NOW 
Is it that surprising that AUD/USD correlations with risk assets/domestic data has broken down? The main source of support for the Australian basic balance has been foreign direct investment towards the mining sector. The inflow is based on stable. multi-year investment plans, and is therefore insensitive to 10% swings in the S&P 500 or even month-on-month moves in the China PMI. Last year, FDI continued moving higher, in line with rising mining investment forecasts. All survey-based evidence suggests that the peak in mining investment is happening this year, however. And the big drop in capital goods imports in today's trade report arguably foreshadows this bigger slowdown in FDI.

3. Commodities much weaker this year compared to 2012 
Last year, there wasn't really a big gap between the price of Australia's commodity exports and AUD/USD. For instance, the big drop in iron ore was offset by the resilience of gold, which has a big weight in the RBA commodity price index. This year is different however: the decline in commodities is broad-based and the gap that has opened up between commodities is meaningful. Based on our ""live"" proxy of the RBA commodity price index (includes contract pricing), AUD/USD ""fair value"" is currently running below 95 cents.

468,2013-05-12,GBP/USD Weekly Outlook 12 May,"Hey guys, time for another one of these! I'll just copy my post here:

Two weeks ago we were [looking at Cable around 1.524](http://www.irafx.com/trades/gbpusd/how-to-trade-gbpusd-weekly-outlook-29-april) and wondering whether it would run to channel top or break through. We’re now in a similar situation, after some gargantuan dollar moves this week.

Here’s what I’m looking at (8hr chart):

http://i.imgur.com/VBYqJ17.png

 We have a nice spike through the channel, and a late Friday retracement to close the week still inside it. To many, this is a bullish signal, and a sign that the trend will continue.

However, I believe that an important top is in place at 1.56 – the 50% mark of the big decline earlier this year. The Elliot Wave guys are going nuts over this, I’m told. It does look wavy.

Moving on, expect to see a bounce here. The dollar is probably going to give back some of what it ripped from the majors on Thursday and Friday, but this massive move has fundamental underpinnings that are starting to show strength.

**Why is This Happening?**

I’m not going to go into an analysis of dollar performance this week, but the move has many cited causes. It essentially boils down to investors chasing yield. Japanese foreign bond buying showed that for the second week in a row Japanese businesses bought more foreign bonds. The US put out good job numbers, pointing to an increase in the pace of the broad US economic recovery. These two factors combined left every investor looking for quick, easy, low-risk cash buying up US debt. It just so happened that this pushed the majors lower, and through some important support.

**Trade Set Ups This Week**

I currently hold short from 1.5580, with a stop above 1.5640, I have taken half profit, and my bias is wholly bearish. So I’m unlikely to be doing much apart from adding to my position. But this is a longer term play, and it’s based on the idea that 1.5600 is in fact a top. If it’s not, I’ll be wrong. But I’m willing to pay 60 pips (and half my gains) to find that out.

**For those looking for a bounce, there’s a good setup:**

Buy at market, with a stop below Friday’s low, targeting 1.5500. Expect **resistance around 1.540/20.** I personally don’t think an upmove is good for more than this, but other traders see a trendline and are going to be buying. We could see another run at 1.56. A break above here changes our bias to bullish, and really ruins my week. 

If you take this position, I strongly advise actively managing it. Take half off equal to risk and move stops to breakeven ASAP. 

**For those looking lower:**

Selling after a lot of selling isn’t easy, but there are two ways to play this.  The first is to wait for a bounce up to 1.540/20 and see if it’s stopping there, and then short. If it looks like it’s blasting through, **wait for 1.5450, or 1.550.** All of these are likely levels for a bounce to stop. I would advise against placing limit orders, and rather wait for a good sell signal on the 4hr charts or something. A nice inverted hammer would be great.

If we get an immediate break of the channel first thing on Monday (via a gap), then don’t sell immediately. Price will likely find **support at Friday’s low, followed by 1.5300 and 1.5250**, offering the chance to sell a rally. 

1.535 would be a good place to get back in here, but price may not get all the way up here, so stay nimble. Rather get in with a smaller position and a wide stop than not get in at all, because price will clearly be heading lower.

Here are those two possible set ups on the 4hr chart:

469,2013-05-12,"USD/CHF Weekly Outlook, (after a massively successful trendline bounce)","Last week I posted a [potential trendline bounce setup on USD/CHF](http://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1di139/usdchf_trendline_bounce_up_for_grabs/). You could say it worked out rather well.

It took a couple of days to hit my target of 0.94, but I'm actually still in this trade, sort of. I've taken most off my position, and then added again when we returned to 0.952 briefly. Having said that, I was probably caught up in the heat of the moment, and 0.95 would have been a better re-entry point.

There's also a case for the bears here, so let's look at the set ups for USD/CHF.

**8Hr Chart:**

http://i.imgur.com/bZCNoTM.png

That last 8Hr candle is a bull's worst nightmare, so why am I still in this trade? The break of the wedge is encouraging, sure, but the larger wedge top has halted advances for now. We could easily see 0.9500 or even 0.9420/00 early in the week if the dollar rally loses steam. But here's why it might not. That means it's time to...

**Talk About Fundamentals!**

Why did the US Dollar rally so much? There are a lot of ideas floating around. It wasn't broad-based risk aversion, although it looked like it if you were watching the Aussie and the Pound. What most likely caused it was the search for yield, as investors lost confidence in Japanese government bonds, and the US economy started to look even healthier. Good jobs numbers mean a chance of tapering QE sooner than expected, which is one of the only things propping up the riskier assets.

Stocks didn't follow through, which leaves me suspicious. The Yen crosses were actually up (although in a much more muted fashion than USD/JPY). But the most telling sign comes from EUR/USD.

I'm gonna get a little ahead of myself here and take a page from [Jamie Saettele's book](http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/technical/elliott_wave/usd-chf/2013/05/09/eliottWaves_usd-chf.html) (DailyFX). EUR/USD and USD/CHF have always been highly negatively correlated. That correlation breaks down sometimes, but it's usually there. When we have highly correlated assets, we can look to the correlated asset for confirmation of a big move in the first asset. A good example is gold and silver. If gold makes a new high but silver does not confirm that new high with its own, then chances are the next move in gold is down.

So if we get a night high in USD/CHF, we're looking for a new low in EUR/USD. **And we got it.**

Price went briefly down to 1.2950. Here's the 8hr chart of EUR/USD showing USD/CHF in white:

http://i.imgur.com/Xmcn3Bq.png

So the next move for both of these, in the medium term, is probably a continuation of Friday's moves. However, as you can see EUR/USD looks to be bouncing off its trendline, and USD/CHF failed to break close above the larger wedge top. This leaves some doubt as to this week's likely moves.

**USD/CHF Trade Set Ups**

There's a case for both bulls and bears. If you believe that this dollar move was impulsive and likely to retrace, there are sell signals aplenty. Trade would be simple:

**Sell at market, with a stop above 0.963, targeting 0.945 initially (former wedge top which could act as interim support) and then 0.9300 (ascending wedge bottom).**

However, I believe that what is happening is something of a paradigm shift, as investors finally start to click that their best chance of reliable yield is in US Treasuries. I would like to see the move confirmed by a EUR/USD trendline break, and a similar move from the S&P500. If we do get that, expect the larger wedge to break, and for this pair to enjoy a lot more upside.

I am currently long from 0.9271. I took a third off at 0.94, another third off at 0.9550, my final target is open, and I am **so fucking smug right now**. I added at 0.9520, and will add a final third (bringing me back to the original position size) if we see the 0.9500/0.9460 area again. I intend to hold this trade until I am stopped out, either by a full retracement, or because my trailing stop was hit. I will trail the stop manually whenever new lows are formed.

This means I will be trailed out by the creation of a lower low - an indication that party time is over.

471,2013-05-13,"James Stanley's ""Fingertrap"" Scalping Strategy (also good for longer term trading)","I posted this elsewhere a while back, but I thought I'd put it in /r/forex and not on the blog, because it's my absolute favourite tool in all of Forexland.

James Stanley is a (very good) trader and educator at DailyFX (Twitter: [@JStanleyFX](https://twitter.com/JStanleyFX)). He's also very friendly and helpful on Twitter if you have serious questions.

**Here's the [link to the original article](http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2012/03/26/Short_Term_Momentum_Scalping_in_Forex.html)** but what I'm going to do is explain it in a little more detail, show you how James uses it, and then explain how I use it for finding entries on longer term trades and breakouts.

There's also this helpful video you can watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrxOiAhIlaQ


Right, so before I explain what it is, here's a checklist for WHEN the Fingertrap strategy is effective:

* Is the market trending TODAY? (short term trend, not choppy action)
* Is it nowhere near a place it could? stop (important fib, trendline, the basic stuff)
* Is it the morning of the NY session? (it works best during this time)
* Is it a fairly active pair with a tight spread? (if you're going to be scalping)

**If the answer to all those questions is yes, you're ready to go:**

**1:** switch to an hourly or 2hr chart, so you can see what movement on the day is like. You should be able to spot a strong directional bias if there is one, and you may have already done analysis to find important support and resistance. 

**2:** Add two indicators: an 8 period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and a 34 period EMA. I don't know why those numbers, and different combinations might work better on different pairs (EUR/JPY tends to throw a lot of false signals with this, as does gold, so it's worth experimenting). We use EMAs and not SMAs because they respond more quickly. Here I'm looking at EUR/JPY on 2hr chart, on 26 April 2013):

http://i.imgur.com/9wqd36U.png

**3:** Is price clearly above or below BOTH moving averages (eg. it's a downtrend and price is below both, or an uptrend and it's above) AND has the 8 EMA crossed over the 34 EMA (crossed to the downside if you're looking at a downtrend). These two factors are a strong confirmation of a trend, if you need one.

**4:** Once you have confirmed that a trend is in place, switch to your preferred scalping timeframe. I usually use 5m or 1m charts. You'll now see that the 8EMA (which is the only one we're looking at from now on) hugs the price quite closely.

**5:** If we're in a downtrend, what we are looking for is for price to ideally break through some kind of support, and then to rebound to the 8EMA. It can push through it, even close a whole candle above it, but should eventually move back down below it.

**This is your signal to enter short.** As you can see from the chart below (same time, 5m chart), it's essential that you determine that there is a trend first and not just some jumping around.

http://i.imgur.com/pvjgeKg.png

**6:** The idea is to use relatively small trade sizes, and scale in and out of the trade rapidly. When price extends quite a bit away from the 8EMA, that's the time to take partial profits, wait for a rebound to the 8EMA, and then enter again.

**7:** The game ends when the 8EMA crosses the 34EMA again, and price is on the other side of both of them

The idea is that, even with strong moves, there are quick pullbacks. This strategy helps to give you an edge in determining where those pullbacks are likely to stop. It's not perfect, but no strategy is. The point is that it gives you a higher probability of entering at a good time (buying relatively low, or selling relatively high), and it also means you can have a lower risk entry (being closer to the last swing high).

Now, I don't get to do a lot of scalping because I have a day job, but I do use this for breakouts, and just any regular old entry as a matter of habit (unless I'm doing a fairly long term trade and 10 pips either way doesn't matter that much to me).

What I will do is wait for a breakout or a strong move in the direction I want. Then I put my Fingertrap template on, and wait for price to ""reload"" to the moving average before getting in, placing my stop above a nearby swing high. My stop will always be placed while thinking about how long I plan to hold the trade.  If I'm looking for a move in GBP/USD from 1.56 down to 1.50, I'm not going to place my stop above the nearby swing high on the 5m chart - I'm going to place it around 1.5650. So you have to use your discretion obviously. 

For example, I will be watching EUR/USD very closely for a break of 1.3000 or 1.2950, and then employ it from there.

For scalping, the nearby swing high is definitely a good place to put it - if the trade goes that badly away from you, you definitely want to be out.

However, I'm actually at a bit of a loss here. The Aussie has really fallen and it's still going, but for how long? I'm pretty bearish the Euro right now, so going long here doesn't sit well with my fundamentals. I like the technical break, but I'd prefer to buy at a better level.

Who knows, maybe tomorrow we see a massive Aussie rally, and then this becomes just another peek above the trendline.

Then I'm selling and not stopping until 1.22

474,2013-05-13,I Really Like AUD/JPY Right Now,"Not trying to spam the subreddit but I'm seeing so many great setups!

AUD/JPY is relativey ""cheap"" compared to the other Yen crosses, and some might say the Aussie is due a rebound. I'm not one of them, but I will let the market speak for itself.

As of 10 minutes ago, USD/JPY once again failed at 102.00.  Not saying it's all over, but it means a little more downside is probably likely, and some sideways action (I hate that part).

Here's AUD/JPY 4hr chart:

http://i.imgur.com/mWVQNso.png

That trendline support goes back to the bottom, so it's fairly hefty. That wedge is terminal in the next 3 days or so.

If you're bullish the Aussie, this is a relatively cheap risk-positive trade:

Buy at the trendline, around 100.80, with a stop below 100 (preferably at 90.75 to give it some room to bounce, but I know that's a lot for some people). Price is likely to find plenty of bids here, so you should see it reacting to this level.

Target could be the moon, really - I'm more interested in the downside.

A break here targets 99.40 and then 97.50. Not saying we'll get here, and this move from USD/JPY doesn't look like it's going to correct THAT sharply (but who knows). Either way it's probably good for a few pips. 

Technically, the upside trade is easier, having less to run into immediately apart from the nearby swing high at 105. That's a good enough target with a good Risk:Reward ratio.

To the downside, you'll have to play it by ear and take your pips when you can. Unless it falls off very sharply in which case I'll be more interested in EUR/JPY.

As a side note, Morgan Stanley issued an FX advisory to their clients the other day saying that they believe current price action has over-run their momentum indicators, and the real capital leaving Japan, and that 102 in USD/JPY is likely a medium term top.

They recommend shorting USD/JPY below 101.00, with a stop above 102.00, targeting around 94.00.  I say them's fighting words.",4,0.71

476,2013-05-14,GBP/AUD - Breakout or Trendline Bounce or...?,"Here's what I'm looking at on the daily:

http://i.imgur.com/lXo0DBa.png

Now, First I saw a trendline and wanted to buy at it, but then I noticed the much larger descending wedge top, where we are now.  I thought about it, shorted it, got stopped out on continued Aussie weakness.

Now, however, it looks like we're on the verge of either a major breakout or a big, big reversal.

If the Aussie does continue to weaken and break through the support it is currently bouncing off (0.980), we could very well see a massive breakout here, even if the pound does nothing. 

The pound itself is at the 50% retracement of the 50% retracement of the big move :) Sounds like an arb level but actually it's a good place for a bounce, and we might get that in the next couple of sessions. Price action is fractal, after all.

I guess it depends on which of these levels holds.  If USD strength continues, I don't know which I expect to fall faster. The Aussie is on 7 days of consecutive decline, the longest since 2005 I believe. The pound hasn't fallen that far at all really.

Any thoughts here?",5,0.86

485,2013-05-25,Let's Talk Fundamentals (because they might be important this week),"This is more of a brain dump to encourage discussion, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.

**Something strange happened this week.** 

Stocks fell off - mostly Japanese stocks, but equity markets everywhere suffered nasty losses. The S&P 500 shat a nasty reversal candle on Thursday, and the Nikkei posted one of its largest falls in history on Friday. 

At the same time bonds fell (yields rose). The US Dollar also fell.

That's not how it's supposed to work.

When stocks fall, bond yields fall (bond prices rise) because more people buy them. Where the hell was the money going? 

Into the Yen and the Swiss Franc, mostly. The Yen because most of the action was in Japan. The USD/JPY and Nikkei 225 are HEAVILY correlated. I can't tell if the fall in stocks preceded the fall in USD/JPY (and AUD/JPY, which many say led the way), or if it was the other way around, but either way we had classic risk aversion kicking in.

USD/JPY posted its largest weekly decline since 2011.

There was some jawboning, and data from Japan to suggest that the new QE measures are working. 

**But wait a second:** they've only just started. That money hasn't really filtered down to anywhere where it's actually being used to power the economy. The only real effect so far has been a massive uplift in stocks. This is because a lot of the Nikkei 225 is made up of exporters and multi-nationals, and a falling Yen boosts their *expected* profits - nobody's actually made any money yet.

The technicals still only say ""retracement"", not ""reversal"", but we're hanging in by a thread - **especially USD/JPY**. If we break Friday's low, 100 is in sight. If this break is for real, this psychological barrier will mean absolutely nothing.

After this 97.00 is next, then 95.00/94.50, then 92. I don't think any fall would get down to 92, or even 94, but 97 is highly possible by the end of this week - and if we get there, it could be in a matter of minutes.

**Before I go on, COT data**

*(For newbie traders, COT means Commitment of Traders, and it's a series of complicated charts showing net speculative futures positioning. When you overly it onto price data, you will find that extremes of short positioning tend to precede massive rallies. This is because a LOT of people get increasingly short as price starts to fall, which reaches an extreme as it continues to fall. Price starts to come back up, and the extreme extends a little bit more, before you get a short squeeze and everyone buys furiously to get out of unprofitable short positions)*

Aussie COT showed a massive extreme in short positioning: http://stocktwits.com/message/13774559

So did the Japanese Yen: http://stocktwits.com/message/13774580

The most telling is the S&P500: http://stocktwits.com/message/13774599

The light blue line says that the big money is getting more and more out of stocks (or since it's futures positioning, they're starting to bet it will fall)

All other things being equal, this means these two are probably due a large correction. All other things might not be equal, however. Extremes in quiet times can become the norm in unusual circumstances - bear this in mind.

**This is the scenario if Asian stocks lead the fall.** Longs are clearly nervous, but the docket is light this week. This alone could be enough - with minor bad news sparking panic selling. The US Dollar could see some initial selling purely on USD/JPY, pushing the majors higher. This will happen during the Asian session. If it happens in the morning, you will see European markets open lower, and we might get early USD weakness as USD/JPY sells off. 

But it won't last. The risk aversion will spill into European and US stocks as these markets open, and they may gap significantly lower. In this case the Swiss Franc will strengthen first, followed by the US Dollar. So I don't like USD/CHF so much here. The US Dollar will almost certainly surge once US markets open.

If this is the real deal, (**and that is the biggest fucking ""IF"" ever** because many have called this reversal lots of times and have given up after being wrong repeatedly) this dollar surge will be enormous. The world will be waking up from its dream of a fragile recovery that has been overblown by surging stock markets.

**Stock markets have been rallying for mixed reasons.**  Some of it is investor confidence, but most of it is simply the search for yield, which most cash investments can't provide at the moment. Dividend yields in stocks are good, and fund managers have been buying them because they need to beat indices, which are rising more quickly than the values of their portfolios. This cycle has fed itself, and stocks have risen, even though demand for those companies' products and services has remained tepid.

If this happens, the Yen crosses will be blown to bits, as will the majors. But don't just go short everything if you see it falling. It will be difficult to know whether it's the real thing, and you'll have to be in front of your trading screen at the time (unless you want to set breakout orders)


**We are seeing all the signs of a minor bubble bursting.** 

The headlines have been all about markets hitting new highs, and everybody buying stocks. That is usually a sign that the smart money has started selling their large holdings to incoming retail investors, and that a lot of the profit from the bull run has been made. If stocks start to look wobbly up here, the last ones in will be the first ones out.

Look at USD/JPY or the other Yen crosses zoomed out to 2005. The rise is absurd. I showed it to my girlfriend, who doesn't know the first thing about Forex, and she said it looked unnatural and if she had to guess, the next move would be ""down a bit"". This kind of woke me up a little - it was so obvious because the move up seems to be against the laws of nature, even if backed by fundamentals. Humans are good at pattern recognition, and even she could look at previous price action and recognize that a sharp rise like this almost never happens without a bit of falling. 

It all depends on where you bought.

For example, if you had held USD/JPY since 92.00, and you planned to hold it for the rest of the year, you wouldn't worry so much about a drop to 97 (though it would be annoying).  If you were long on a break of 100.00, you would be getting the fuck out. Your stop might be at 100, or maybe you'd locked in 50 pips. The point is that longs are now nervous, and bids will be hard to find below 100. Most people are probably prepared to take a chance buying a dip into around 100 (I know I am), but not below there. 

**Below there are stop losses. Hundreds of millions of them.** 

So that's my take on things. I'm not saying the world will end this week, but we all know that what goes up very quickly when there isn't a good reason to do so, usually comes down pretty quickly as well.

Others would argue with my fundamentals. I've seen articles saying that the rise in stocks can be attributed to companies holding on to cash reserves and paying high dividends, because they are worried that the recovery might not come. When they finally do see it coming, they will start spending that cash on growing and employing people - so maybe stocks are leading the global economy in this recovery.

**I say horse shit.** Demand has to precede supply, and right now the powerhouses of the global economy have more supply capacity than there is demand for. We have got into this situation because corporate profits have stayed very good during the last few years, but household incomes have fallen in real terms, and the average consumer is no better off, even though central bank governors are starting to say otherwise.

You and I are still earning far less money than we should be, and spending proportionally more and more of it every year as wage growth struggles to keep up with inflation, which is already low in most developed countries. Corporate profits continue to do well, but this money is not being spent in the real economy and used to create jobs.

I'm not going to go all marxist here for my last thoughts, but it is important to realise that there is a continuing and growing concentration of wealth in the hands of the few. They might say that they are the job creators, and many of them are. But for the most part they are the wealth hoarders. That money goes into things that *cause the economy to appear to be growing*, but do not actually grow the real economy - company stock, large assets, investments.

They also buy things from companies that are seeing their profits grow faster than the wages they pay. Where a dozen board executives get huge bonuses and a hundred thousand shareholders see their balance sheets grow, the people who are actually spending their portion of that company's profits (the employees) don't have any more money to inject into the economy than they did last year.

These market forces are going to collide sooner or later. Either:

* Wage growth and unemployment suddenly improves, and the middle and working classes will actually be able to provide the demand that the supply side needs to see to continue growing, or
* the middle classes will start to spend money they don't have as a result of stimulus programs, which will kick in as central banks realise that they are failing to restart economies through austerity. This will sustain the recovery and it might work, but sovereign balance sheets are already stretched ridiculously far, or 
* stocks will crash before that happens, causing a resurgence of widespread unemployment. 

I'm not saying it will happen this week, or at all. All I'm saying is that stocks are rising very quickly on not much at all. There are precedents for this throughout history, and it never ends well. When you hear hoof beats, don't think zebras.

487,2013-05-27,New to learning forex. Some questions. Thank you.,"Hi All!

I am currently learning about Forex at Babypips.com. There are a couple of questions on my mind that I would like to ask. There are some things I am still not sure about. I am currently learning about the technical aspect of it. I signed up for a Practice Account at Oanda. 

I am still very new to learning Forex so some of these questions are very basic, do bear with me. Thank you.

1) Margin: I understand that margin is the money you deposit to the broker to control a larger funds. 
My question is,
I use a 10:1 margin. I deposited $1000, so I get to control $10,000. What if I lose all the ""$10,000"". Do I owe the broker (in my case Oanda), $9000? Since I am technically, ""borrowing"" the other amount.

2) Amount paid to broker: If I am understanding this correctly, Oanda earns from spread. 

For example, EUR/USD 1.2920/1.2924 The spread is the difference, which is 0.0004. 4 Pips. Am I right? 

Supposed I buy 10,000 units of EUR. 

10,000 x 1.2924 = $12,924 

In this case, how do I find out how much am I going to pay the broker?

**EUR/USD Trade Approach For The Next Four Weeks**

Let me show you a [chart about sentiments of professional institutions, courtesy of DJFX](http://www.irafx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/eu2-27may2013.jpg). What does it tell us about these professional institutions? They are unsure. But overall the general consensus is that there will be a steady decline in the euro through till 2014. Much of the uncertainty stems from policy decisions, especially the banking union proposed by the ECB but is meeting objection from several member countries. One of the key issues in the proposal is the formation of an agency dubbed ""Single Resolution Mechanism"", whereby it forces creditors and shareholders to bear the losses instead of taxpayers. You can immediately see which group will object to it, and how markets are likely to react.
  

On one hand, even if the banking union be established successfully, would it work? On the other hand, if nothing new is being done, the markets have no confidence. Despite having availability of cheap credit, lenders are still very cautious and businesses are not very confident. So for the time being, optimism lies on the cooperation of all the member countries with the ECB. This does not look to be achievable until 2014. So I still hold a short bias for the euro and prefer to sell on rallies.

I'm not saying it's THE low, but it looks to be a short term low, maybe good for another bounce.  Recent comments on the wires from some Fed guy seem to have helped things along.

**UPDATE** Before I even finished this post, the dollar stopped looking healthy again. I'm still in these trades, and I still believe these supports will hold, but use your discretion. Note that these are all small positions (risking around 0.25% of my account each) as I realise they are all USD exposed.

Here are the trades I've been looking at today, and the ones I just got into. There is still time if you like the look of them, but wait for a bit of a dip.

**USDJPY 2hr chart:**

This one's a bit of a gamble as we've had a hard time cracking resistance and there are sell orders stacked above it. Target is only 102 - not shooting for the moon here. Stop at around 100.55. To confuse the new people, I trade on two platforms and on two accounts sometimes. So where the trade isn't obviously shown I have marked it with dashed lines.

I bought here yesterday and it worked out well. Don't ask about the -13.8 pips.

**USD/CAD** 4hr chart

This one's a bit overcooked, but I'm willing to take a punt on another 80 pips or so. I do quite like the break of the major resistance, and now we're coming back to test it.

Not liking my trade right now so I don't know about this one.  1.300 is probably a better entry if we get there.

The purple line just above my target is a fibonacci expansion. I don't use them often except when a trend is in uncharted territory. It helped me trade EUR/JPY from 120.80 to 130, so I quite like them now

I quite regret being in a short that is underwater right now, because it's looking like taking another serious run at $1400 and I will be stopped out. That's what you get for spending too much time staring at short term charts. There probably isn't the momentum to crack $1400 right now, but you never know. My stop is at $1405


**USD/CHF 2hr:**

Loving this pair right now. Fallen out of bed a little bit, but we're at support and my strategy is to buy in an uptrend when we're at support, so this is an exercise in sticking to the rules really.  Hoping for a repeat of yesterday's performance.

Chart's a bit of a mess, but the pink fib is the recent downtrend and the grey fib is the big down move earlier this year.

0.23 fib level of the recent down move, the day's high more or less, also lines up with the 0.23 fib of the larger countertrend rally (not shown on chart)

Looking for a move back to recent lows, stop above this fib level which price seems to have responded to nicely.

The falling gold price is impacting the income of some of its biggest earners, and the ZAR has fallen to its lowest level against the USD in years.

AUD/USD 2Hr:

COT data shows that Aussie shorts are only 10k contracts away from a new record. If it rallies and stops start getting hit, it will rally fast. This could be massively accelerated by a dollar tumble. Believe it or not, risk aversion will actually help this, as people bail on the long dollar trade and seek yield.

I believe that USD weakness will be a theme in the beginning of the week, and that the Aussie remains oversold. Failure to make a new low on Friday could see us rebound into 0.97.  If the lows aren't taken out in early monday trading, I'll look to go long into this level. Fairly good risk/reward ratio, if nothing else.

Carrying on with the theme of USD weakness, ISM manufacturing on Monday will likely either send the dollar off the edge or give us a rally.  If we get a USD rally, the Aussie will most likely fall through support and I'll be less interested.  If we get more USD weakness, which i think we will, we should see a strong Aussie rally. The RBA is likely to not cut rates again, sending this pair higher.  Where the best entry will be, I'm not quite sure yet.

A daily close above 0.97 gives us a good chance of going through 0.98 up to around 0.9850, and that's where I think the dream will die.

AUD/CAD might be a good pair to watch in this situation, as CAD weakness seems to be quite a thing right now.

Which brings me to CAD/JPY. I often ignore this pair, but it has one of the cleaner technical setups of the Yen crosses.

We are pretty much at the major trendline, but I don't want to be a buyer here. I'm looking to sell into the top of this falling wedge, ONLY IF we see signs of failure here. This is a bullish continuation pattern. We've seen these fail on EUR/JPY before, but that will depend on a lot of things.  In the near term, I think we can look for a failure up around 97.50, for a move back down to 95.90.

NZDUSD

This is a big one. The trendline it is now at or approaching (give or take 100 pips) has held for years. But that's what they said about the AUD/USD one. However, RSI is giving us an oversold signal and bullish divergence. I don't usually use RSI, except with NZD/USD, where it tends to be fairly useful.

Daily Chart:

http://i.imgur.com/5bgh9VM.png

Right now it's falling on Wheeler's comments that the Kiwi is overvalued, and the general commodities malaise, but I expect this trendline to provide some serious support. USD weakness in the early part of the week could play a part.  I'm looking for an initial test of the trendline and a bit of a bounce, and then will look to buy a dip back towards the trendline.

I don't expect it to rally for long, but there should be some kind of reaction unless the trendline breaks straight away.

USD/CHF

Okay this pair is kind of starting to piss me off. To me it quite purely represents USD strength, more than EUR/USD and USD/JPY. Unless the SNB is doing anything funny, it tends to correlate quite closely with the US dollar index as a whole.

2hr chart: http://i.imgur.com/JYxVAwc.png

I'm looking to sell a rally into 0.96 - but if anyone thinks it will go higher, I'd love to hear it. I don't want to sell a rally into 0.96 and then we go to 0.97 before falling again. I'll keep an eye on PA at these levels.

Either way I think 0.948 is a line in the sand that offers good support. I will be watching this level closely for support ahead of Friday's NFPs, which given the previous trend is likely to send the dollar much higher.

I think that event risk will change a lot of things. If the dollar falls until then, it could mark the end of the correction. If it's bad data, we could see it start off a much larger dollar depreciation. ",8,0.85
492,2013-06-01,"RSI Divergence on many AUD, NZD and CAD pairs.","I've been doing my weekend analysis, and for a laugh I decided to throw RSI on some of the commodity majors and crosses I've been following. Among these are AUD/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD and EUR/CAD. We will probably find the same thing in EUR/NZD and GBP/NZD but I don't trade these pairs.

Here I don't really get what's going on. New high in RSI but not in the pair. Before Friday we had two pin bars, with a third forming up.  Then the Cad shat weirdly after GDP, sending this pair into resistance again. 

Any thoughts?

GBP/AUD:

This one's a bit more clear cut. Very strong divergence, but clearly a lot of momentum

http://i.imgur.com/uMHTJsk.png

And lastly EUR/AUD - more of the same really. Except it's the 3rd highest overbought level that I have price data for. All of the previous ones heralded massive corrections.

On this one, the divergence is most recent. I don't know if that means we have to wait longer for a correction, or what. Either way, I'm not comfortable taking a position here until things even out.

One thing about this pair though: it is always trending, and reversals tend to be sharp.  If we hang around this level for a few days without making a new high, I will look to enter short near the highs.

Trade: Small shorts > Small longs. (As opportunity presents)
  
  
**EUR**: Loads of PMI, GDP, ECB rate. Markets believe it to be poor but have shown continued optimism. Will take at least a firm rate cut #2 for the push towards 1.23. If not, dont be surprised at irrational rallies.

Trade: Big shorts > Small longs. (As opportunity presents)
  

**USD**: FOMCs, PMI, Trade Balance, ADP, PMI, Jobless Claims, NFP, Unemployment. The big week for USD, Strength to be continued? Last week we saw cautious USD bulls. If data confirms, bull run. If not, probably nothing for the USD. Bigger upside than downside.

Trade: Big long > Small shorts. (As opportunity presents)

Today I had a great trade - I sold at 0.9610 down to 0.95 - little did I know it would spike to 0.94!

That big line, 0.9480 - it s a big pivot. Right now it's where sellers and buyers are doing battle, and have done so for a while now. If price fails here, the uptrend is over for now and the move is back to that orange trendline.

However, we can shed a little bit of light on this by adding an Andrews Pitchfork, which is really just a channel but based on the idea that a trend will tend to gravitate towards the centre of this channel.

http://i.imgur.com/QCodBJX.png

One of the strategies using this pitchfork is to look for a break, and then use some kind of oscillator to determine whether a retracement to the centre of the channel is likely. They tend to work quite well.

I know not to use indicators that don't fit with your trading strategy. Personally I will look for a close above that yellow line and signs that we're holding.

498,2013-06-04,One key philosophy that defined me as a retail trader. Always Remember: Conviction is important.,"On here early this morning (light data day so we've got some downtime before our coverage) and wanted to post something I notice A LOT amongst the online comments and retail crowds.  Don't be so quick to abandon ship or change the direction of where you see price action moving.

By that, I don't mean this in the sense of sticking with losing trades, averaging down (losers average losers), or bad strategies.  I mean this with regards to people that are far too easily convinced at the slightest dip, a full trend change has occurred.  Whether its because of some indicator they look at that they want to tell the future or because a specific line was broken that they drew...  **Remember, market trends don't change because you think they do.  Markets change when the expectations of the whole of the market participants turn.**

First, keep in mind that just because you have a particular trendline off two arbitrary points doesn't mean Joe Shmo at xyz capital and the 50 others in a PM position like him who's dropping $500 million USD on daily position movements is seeing the same line... or using a line at all.

An example this week has been with USDJPY.  I have seen plenty of comments floating around (not necessarily here) like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1flsl4/the_case_for_buying_usdchf_tomorrow/cablrs0) where a perfectly reasonable correction in a strong fundamentally backed USD bull trend leads to an ""all aboard the short train"".  I'm not doing this to single anyone out... plenty of comments like this can be seen over at ForexLive (been friends with a couple of the contributors over the years and occasionally post comments) where purely stop driven short selling on the first retest of 100 since it gapped 60 pips across the line all of a sudden means we're going to revisit 95's and to sell everything with a pulse because ""the trend has changed"".  Then comes the flurry of ""confused"" comments wondering why the USD isn't sinking.

Ultimately, this comes down to basic market discipline of having objective judgement skills.  Not getting swept up in the motion of the price action or more importantly... not getting swept up just because you have a position/financial stake in one answer or another (fading trends is a perfectly fine strategy so long as you don't presume each fading moment is a paradigm shift in the price's future movements).  ***You need to be able to step back to determine without prejudice, if the trend truly is in fact broken.***  If you can't make a definitive conclusion on this from an objective point of view, then don't trade.  Trading on guessing is flat out gambling.  You're flipping a coin and hoping your guess is the same as the side of the coin.  I'll tell you right now... Multi year currency trends don't change direction just because an indicator is overbought or a convergeance/divergeance of ""*insert random arbitrary measure here*"".  If you mark the G10's major pair trends over the past 5 years, you can isolate the true changes in trends with shifts in the global paradigm of market flows.  You can usually isolate shifts like this to policy shifts as well.  This was the case in the constant up and down of the EUR/USD over the course of the EU Sovereign Debt crisis.  Each shift came from a change/agreement in how to further handle the crisis (ESM, etc).  This is also why so many large macro funds made an ungodly amount of money during the past 6 months on the JPY.  They recognized when the shift came from the large picture and chose entry points on the small picture.

Yesterday proved a great example of this challenge to new traders in USD/JPY action with the ISM.  It's been getting beaten on pretty badly with the large downward push in the Nikkei and had been sitting at 100.40 with buying attempts finding no ground.  This indicated a good presence of market mind wanting to move downwards (with obvious stops at 100 being the obvious goal) and just waiting on a catalyst.  If you stepped back for a moment though, nothing had changed.  The largest QE program in history was still in full swing and USD yields were still rising (general gauge of attraction from jpy to USD can be viewed as the differential of JGB 10 years and 10 yr US Treasuries).  I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1fjj28/new_week_get_clicking_traders_give_me_3_anything/cab87co) prior to the 10am ISM report when it was still floating in the 100.40's and sure enough, we had a nice bounce when we ran into buyers and short profit takers below 99.  Even for you guys that love the tech/trendline trading, this showed a bounce at the 55 day EMA and close to the daily trendline spanning from last November.  This board should have been filled with comments about how great a chance this USD dip is to get a position in (or take profits if you're fading).... yet the retail comment consensus seemed to be swept up in a flurry of ""yay short USD"" and ""sell bounces!"", despite no fundamental landscape change or even technical viewpoint supporting greater breaks lower than yesterday's lows.

As we sit right now, I could be completely proven wrong and this could be a trend change.  Price could go back below 100 and push further lows into the mid 90's for all I know... and I will be the first to admit I am wrong when that happens.  That doesn't change the point of this wall of text though.

I'm going to attempt to analyse **USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY, NZD/JPY, CAD/JPY, CHF/JPY, and ZAR/JPY**. I'm really interested in your feedback, especially from the guys who are good with the supply/demand levels :)

A thought occurred to me while I was regretting eating McDonalds for dinner last night. When there are strong directional moves by one pair, associated pairs and crosses will move in the same way - especially if that move is the result of only one of those currencies strengthening or weakening. Often however, its the associated pairs that will offer a cleaner technical setup.

The purpose of this post is to identify a Yen pair that has the greatest upside potential in the event of the Yen weakening again. It might take a long time to get back up to the highs, so I want a currency with a really good outlook. If you think there is a strong case for a continued move to the downside, I really want to hear it as well.

Likewise on the last big leg up in USD/JPY, when we cracked 100 and then some, I actually lost out a little bit by spreading my trades across EUR/JPY, USD/JPY and GBP/JPY - the rationale being that if the Yen weakened rapidly, the risk trades would do the best against them rather than the dollar (which normally has quite muted moves whenever the Yen weakens rapidly).  Except in that case it was the dollar strengthening, and the Yen fought back against the Euro and Pound.

So I got thinking: **one of these pairs must have the cleanest technicals, the simplest fundamentals, and offer the best risk:reward potential** for a trade to the upside - especially since it's the BoJ in 2 days. 

I'm going to go through the suspects one by one, and just do some basic technical and fundamental analysis. I will only be using trendlines, fibonacci levels and the 50 & 100D SMAs. 

For the purpose of simplicity I have ignored price data pre mid-2012, as most of those levels are gone now. Except the one we're at now - **in almost all pairs the current level has been a significant pivot**, dating back a few years.

Starting with /r/forex's most hated pair:


**USD/JPY**


http://i.imgur.com/W8DRrkU.png

**Technicals** 100 is once again a significant obstacle, and I expect sideways action between here and 96, if the selloff doesn't continue. The Yen might weaken again very sharply, but so also might the dollar. We have a fairly clear and convincing trendline break, and I'm regretting getting in long. We might have a low in place, but we also might not.  We are currently supported at a critical level by the 100DMA and the 0.23 fib, as well as a known demand level. A break lower here targets 95 and then 93.50.


**Fundamentals** We will need a dollar rally as well as a Yen rout to climb quickly, and I'm unwilling to play only one and not the other. Without signs that the US will slow easing and Japan will at least keep it up, we do not have the fundamental driver to push very much higher. 


**Trades** I'm not sure the best trade is to be found here, in either direction. Long seems to be the way forward, but we need some convincing. Otherwise it's sell rallies into 100.


**EUR/JPY**


http://i.imgur.com/ETkvc23.png

**Technicals** If we're looking for the best technical setup for a long, we might have it here. We've spiked through this pair's most significant demand level, bounced off the 100DMA, and closed above the trend line. It's a fairly simple picture.

**Fundamentals** I am slightly concerned by the Euro's lacklustre performance against everything besides the dollar. EUR/GBP is down, EUR/AUD didn't add 200 pips in the last session, etc. That said, I think that the Eurozone is going to start impressing people soon, as long as they can avoid another sovereign debt crisis. Which they won't. It will happen and when it does it will suck this pair down the suck hole faster than USD/JPY ever could.

**Trades** The problem here is that the bottom of Friday's hammer is 280 fucking pips away. I don't know about you guys but I don't like setting stops 280 pips away, especially with limited upside potential right now. I would look for a higher low to form first before getting in long - maybe around 128.50.

A new Eurozone crisis, continued Yen strength and a break of Friday's low could send this pair screeching to a spike low of 115 in a matter of minutes, in my opinion.


**GBP/JPY**


http://i.imgur.com/gv5WVy5.png


**Technicals** Another good long tech setup. A Head and Shoulders pattern was broken and completed on Thursday, with a close above the trend line. 

**Fundamentals** The UK economy is looking better than it has all year, and its recovery is looking set to overtake the Eurozone's. However, Mark Carney comes in next month and we might be staring down the barrel of more dovish MP. This could destroy Cable's fragile recovery, which is showing signs of weakness at a previous pivot level and significant fib.

**Trades** Going long here seems like the obvious choice. A stop would need to be quite wide, but below Thursday's low would probably be sufficient, as we could probably see Friday's low as a bizarre volatility spike that had very little to do with the Pound or the Yen. Mind you that is still 160 pips away, so either wait for a dip or keep your position size very small.


**AUD/JPY**


http://i.imgur.com/EDZigYP.png


**Technicals** This is not a chart that screams, ""go long"", and it makes me worry about the other Yen pairs' upside potential. It could well be that the next significant move lower starts here, as the Aussie continues its collapse. Currently holding at the 50% fib and 200DMA, but any trendlines are long gone and we can expect price consolidation as long as we do not go lower.

**Fundamentals** China released a lot of bad data this weekend, some neutral data, and no good data. The Aussie and Kiwi underperformed against the USD this week, despite being given a massive head start. There is huge scope for further easing, and this currency is strictly in ""sell rallies"" mode. A gold and commodities recovery is the only thing that will save the Australian dollar.

**Trades** I don't like it either way. As has been said on this sub before: what a c*nt of a pair.

**NZD/JPY**


http://i.imgur.com/5pEnfhq.png


**Technicals** An even uglier picture than AUD/JPY, but we have spiked off the 0.38 fib and closed above the 200DMA, if that means anything. A break of Friday's low could get extremely bad very quickly, but this pair isn't known to really motor.

**Fundamentals** The Kiwi actually performed worse than the Aussie this week, closing at the lows and through significant support, while the Aussie staged a late rally. It's hard to be bullish either of these currencies. This is purely due to the commodities slump. Despite tightening MP, the Kiwi looks particularly vulnerable as the entire bloc collapses.

**Trades** I'm not sure the best trade is here, but if Yen strength continues then selling a rally into 77.50 looks like a good play.

**CAD/JPY**

http://i.imgur.com/AdcnwkO.png


**Technicals** 97.50 is the bull/bear line here and we're well through it, so we would need a close above here to be really bullish. Price bounced off the 0.23 fib and 100DMA, and 97.50 once again offers the most serious upside resistance. A break lower here targets 91.50

**Fundamentals** The Canadian dollar staged a late rally on Friday on the back of ridiculously good employment data. USD/CAD is now at descending channel support and the 50% fib of the recent rally, so I would be careful either way. Otherwise I don't know much about the Canadian fundamental picture, but I believe they're happy to see Carney go.

**Trades** Not really sure what to do here. If anyone is more familiar with this pair, let's hear it. Otherwise I'm gonna stay out of this one.

**CHF/JPY**

http://i.imgur.com/4vvoI2o.png


**Technicals** CHF/JPY was actually the biggest gainer in % terms when Japan first announced its QE program. Since then it hasn't done much. Trendline is gone but we've bounced off the 100DMA, which has provided support before. We need above 105 to get really bullish here. There is a very long broken wedge which technically targets 93.

**Fundamentals** I expect the Swiss Franc to weaken if the stock market recovers from here. If it doesn't, and we see a continued decline in stocks, the Yen will strengthen more than the Franc, so we'll probably head down some more. Overall it doesn't look good for this pair. If USD/JPY recovers sharply, USD/CHF probably will as well, so gains here will be muted. If on the other hand gains are driven by fundamental Yen weakening in response to more QE, would could see a large move to the upside.

**Trades**  Buy on a break and hold of 105 only.

**ZAR/JPY**


http://i.imgur.com/SYiZZpd.png

I just put this up for the lolz. Something has gone horribly wrong for South Africa, so if you think the Aussie's had it bad... 

**Technicals**  A break of the 50% fib gives us real cause for concern here. If the Rand continues to weaken as a result of gold weakening, we could see the rally fully retraced. Expect consolidation.

**Fundamentals** The Rand performed worst of all the commodity currencies, as gold continues to slide (it recently broke out of its consolidation to the upside, only to crash on Friday to confirm a break lower again, targeting $1350). When USD/JPY collapsed on Thursday, USD/ZAR barely blinked. I've been trading it to the upside on dips, but 10.00 seems to be capping moves for now. If gold does not recover sharply, the South African economy is going to suffer very badly.

**Trades** F that noise. Buy USD/ZAR on a break of 10.25, or sell it on a break out of consolidation.",10,1.0

518,2013-06-16,Questions for those who use automated strategies,"Hey guys, I've been wondering a few things about automated trading, and I thought some of you might be able to enlighten me.

Every now and then I get out my strategy backtester and plug something basic into it, but I don't really know how to do anything except run the sample strategies that came with it. None of these strategies ever really do anything exceptional in the backtests.

So here's a list of questions. If anyone feels like answering, I'd be much obliged :)

1. How does the actual mechanics of creating an automated strategy work? Do you need to be able to code? How do you go about formulating and creating it.

2. What does an automated strategy actually look like? The ones I've seen are very simple, like RSI ob/os ones and the SSI ones. If you care to share the parameters of how your strategy decides on a trade, I would be really interested to see the level of detail required. My own strategies are extremely simple and have very few hard and fast rules, and are often just about watching price action in a certain area. I can't imagine how this would be coded into rules.

3. Do you apply your strategy all the time, to lots of markets? Or just to one particular market under certain situations? I noticed that a simple RSI strategy did relatively well on AUD/USD, but poorly on EUR/JPY.

4. What do you do if your strategies go haywire and start selling lean hogs and buying orange juice futures or something?

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to answer :)",8,1.0

522,2013-06-21,USD/CAD breakout has now started,"[Daily chart album]( http://imgur.com/a/GS3Kq)

Nothing complicated here. A multi-year trendline dating to early 2010 was broken earlier today on the back of poor Canadian econ data and recent USD strength, and we got a daily close well above it for confirmation. Immediate resistance will be the 127% Fib at 1.04982, which I don't think will hold for too long next week. Any pullbacks towards 1.0420 should be bought, and if there is a retest of that trendline, consider it a gift to go long. I am already in a long position from 1.0430, and will be buying in big size on pullbacks. EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD are also pairs I will be looking at to establish longs. 

On the third chart in the album, I've put on some Fib levels that will likely provide resistance as the pair moves higher, and I've zoomed in on those levels in the fourth chart so you can see the price levels easier. As you can see, there is a lot of room to run on this trade. ",5,0.79

529,2013-07-14,The Tale of USD/CHF and the 200 Week Moving Average,"This has been pointed out by a few analysts I follow. I don't usually use moving averages on this kind of scale, but the significance of this one is... well... significant. 

The reason I consider it especially important is because USD/CHF is inversely correlated with EUR/USD, and tends to be a good barometer of USD strength in general. 

Here's a daily chart, with the 200WMA in white, and the current range we're in: http://i.imgur.com/6lP30hB.png

This pair has not managed a weekly close above the 200WMA since at least 2006 (my chart won't plot the MA further back, but it looks like it carries on forever).  It tested it twice this month, and the recent Bernanke bomb dashed the second attempt on the rocks.

Here's looking in a little closer, with support and resistance levels added.  The blue trendlines are the most recent inside range trends.  This pair is one that tends to obey support-turned-resistance (and vice versa), so previous trendline resistances are of interest for support:

http://i.imgur.com/yc9WQIK.png

The drastic failure to close above the 200WMA makes me hesitant to look for longs here, and points to further general USD weakness over the coming days and weeks. 

However, on the 4hr chart you can see we're finding some support at a previous trendline:

http://i.imgur.com/2n3T6nJ.png

**Trade Setups**

If this medium-term trendline breaks, I would look to short on a retest of 0.9400/25 with a stop above 0.95, and a final target of 0.92 and soft targets at 0.9350 and 0.9275 or something.

If we hold here and bounce, I would look to short about 100 pips above the 200WMA, after some kind of failure in the 0.9750 area.  That would be a great setup for a move down to 0.93 or thereabouts (first target at the 200WMA, just in case it retests it for a final time before breaking above).

I believe that once the fed actually announces some kind of tapering, this moving average will break and it will never be seen again.  Until then, I am going to buy the trendline at the bottom, and sell the range top (I'm not going to wait for it to break back below the 200WMA again, because it has done so very reliably in the past).

Any thoughts/comments?  Any levels you guys are looking at here?

I'm long term bullish USD, but I believe we're going to see some USD weakness coming up. EUR/USD doesn't move 400 pips (even in thin liquidity) for nothing. The slight USD strength we saw on Thursday and Friday is probably just profit taking.  Once we get to support in the majors (could already have been found), I think we'll get the next leg of USD weakness.

The only place I wouldn't sell USD is against AUD, NZD and CAD.",4,0.84

I am now stuck with around 3000 USD which I need to change to Euros by the end of the month, as I will run out of Euros by then and need to pay rent. I was very naive about currency exchange and never realized the various costs and fees that go into the transaction. I know that recently the exchange rate for euros dropped to 2.8 following a report about maintaining low interest rates, but this past week it jumped back up to 1.31, and now is at 1.3.

545,2013-08-21,Matching Currency Direction,"This may seem like a very basic question and it most likely is, but I find the best way for me to learn is to simply ask.

As a trader who generally stays away from true fundamentals and sticks largely to technicals in my trading strategy, consider for example I'm in a position where I'm shorting a pair. Take GBPUSD for example. Assuming a few hours into the trade it's working out in my favour and appears to be following a reliably profitable trend. During this trade I come across a setup that meets my entry requirements and suggests I go long on some other _ _ _ USD pair. Take AUDUSD for example.

From a purely technical standpoint as the majority of my analysis doesn't come from economic information, would it ever be advisable to take a trade in a way that in essence hedges against my original position by simultaneously shorting the USD while longing the same currency in another pair?

I've considered looking at taking trades in shorter time frames to attempt to profit from retracements in the situation discussed above, but I've found I have the most consistent results sticking to the 1 and 4 hour charts so I would prefer to continue doing so.

With this in mind would it be advisable to ignore these new contrary signals, consider closing the original position to take the new trade, or simply view each pair as a separate entity that allows for equal trading opportunity without significant relation to one another due to the non correlating currency in each pair.

I hope this makes sense and I'm happy to clarify if need be!

547,2013-08-23,Help with my bad Forex assumptions!,"I've been reading a little about forex in the past couple weeks, and as a software engineer, I find it appealing that it can be conducted almost entirely via technical analysis (i.e. it's work a computer can do, unlike fundamentals).  A lot of folks on here and around the web have talked about their robo-trading, so I figured one of the best ways for me to learn more would be to write an app and experiment with a test account.

Before that, though, I spent ten minutes writing a simulation to test out some of my assumptions, and see if the math checks out.  I'm sure most of this will be cleared up with practical experience, but I thought I'd quickly ask for a second opinion before spending days (and hundreds/thousands of lines of code) on the problem.

My plan, tentatively, is to do some automated range trading during Asian hours.  Looking at a couple USD/EUR charts to get a feel for how quickly things move, I plugged these values into my ""simulation.""

* Starting capital:  $10,000
* Leverage:  10:1
* Target profit ratio:  2-to-1 (e.g. target 10 pips up or 5 pips down... let winners ride, cut losses)
* Simultaneous positions:  3
* Expected trade duration:  90-120 minutes
* Trading window:  8 hours

With three concurrent positions open and each of them lasting up to two hours, that means the sim is doing ~12 trades per 8-hour day.  Targeting a 2:1 profit ratio, that means only 33% of the trades need to be correct in order to break even.  If I set it to 35% it makes a tidy profit, and if I crank it up to 50% things start to get a little obscene.

This is all math, but I'm better with an IDE than I am with a calculator.  And of course, none of this gets into how to determine where the ranges are -- that's a problem I'll try to solve while writing the actual app.

Before I start writing code... what in there looks totally out of whack?  What am I not taking into account?  I don't consider the numbers coming out of this shitty little mini-program worthwhile, but it was a fun little experiment, and I found myself curious whether any of it was realistic, or if it needed to be significantly reconfigured.

USA will take on the major financial burden of the war like with Iraq and Afghanistan. Other countries will commit troops but again USA will be the main funder. To fund the war the USA will go more into debt again look at Iraq and Afghanistan. 

The biggest issue will be how protracted the war will be. The USA will dominate Syria but Russia and China will be supplying weapons to Syria so it could get messy. 

From memory Russia is protecting its gas pipelines to Europe, if USA runs Syria then the USA will be able to secure pipelines and build new ones that will diminish Russia's control over western European energy supply.

550,2013-08-30,"Is ""stabilization"" good enough for China?","A report from Reuters seems to indicate that the “Chinese economy is stabilizing”. This news gave a fillip to Australian stocks overnight (European time). However, buried deep in the Reuter’s report is the following: 

“Beijing has said it is willing tolerate slower growth as it pushes reforms designed to reduce pollution, social inequity and an economic growth model which has an over-reliance on debt-financed construction and exports.”

We suggest that this indicates that Beijing has nothing to learn from the west about Public Relations spin. The fact of the matter is that China has no option but to work to be able to survive in a period of reduced growth, for the simple reason that a 7 – 8% rise in GDP is unsustainable, and this would be true even if the country had the most advanced social, economic and fiscal structures on the planet, which it does not. 

The law of large numbers, which says, among other things, that such growth is only possible in the short term, is now kicking in. 

All this is having an effect on Australia. China is a major consumer of Iron Ore from Oz but it also has its own supplies, to the extent that it produces some 75% of its own requirements. That means roughly one quarter of Chinese needs comes from imports, mainly but not exclusively from Australia. In the event that there is a slowdown in demand it is not difficult to see which suppliers it will stop using first.

OmicronFX believes that the Australian dollar has some way to go before it reaches its natural level in the circumstances of the decline in the mining economy there. Given the nature of these things, it may even overshoot to the downside. We will not be going long any time soon.

Is there any problem with this approach from a risk perspective? Obviously, I don't plan to make these kinds of trades, but when they happen, just don't seem the harm in holding on until price eventually returns.

I have some questions about which broker is best suited to me. I am from the UK and will have £400 - £500 to put into an account. I want a broker that is regulated by the FSA just for piece of mind. I like the cTrader platform with FxPro but it is an ECN platform. I have found that on EUR/USD it takes £1.08 in commission to complete a trade (entry and exit) with a 10k trade.

I guess I will put my questions in a list to make them easier to answer:

1) With my level of funds, is it better to start with a DD before moving on to an ECN if I am able to grow my account? I feel like that commission doesn't benefit you unless you have a larger account.

2) Which broker do you recommend as a dealing desk. I don't particularly like the idea of the broker almost wanting me to lose, but it will give me bigger wins because of the no commission (of course larger spreads).

3) What ECN broker would you recommend? I would prefer them to offer cTrader as a platform if possible.

There was a notable lack of action in the last week - especially since it's the week after Nopetaper.

The Swissy, however, was quite active. One of the reasons I've heard for this, which I quite like, is that The Swiss Franc was simply the best looking safe haven, given no tapering from the Fed and the impending government shutdown on the US side of things, and the Japanese tax break vote which has made at least a few participants hesitate in buying Yen.

Here's a look at the USD/CHF Weekly chart, to get some perspective. Ignore all the junk at the end.

http://i.imgur.com/zuMAepi.png

The pink line is the 200 **Week** moving average - possibly the strongest dynamic supply level I've ever seen. Following two failed attempts to close above this level, price retreated to the medium-term trend line extending off the February lows. Price tested this trend line 3 times quickly, before breaking it on FOMC day.

Next support was the longer-term trend line off the Feb 2012 and Feb 2013 lows - a very important line.

Here's the daily chart:

http://i.imgur.com/zQ2Goe7.png

That line forms the **neck of a complex head and shoulders pattern**, going back to the beginning of the year.  The level broken on Friday was the year open, the monthly S1 pivot and the neckline of this H&S pattern. The pivot I have on there is a monthly pivot, because this is the scale of the levels we're dealing with.

The moving averages have all turned very negative, and all that's needed is for the 100DMA to cross over the 200DMA to give us a Death Cross. MACD is very negative, though most oscillators will be giving oversold readings on Daily charts, and extremely oversold on 4hr and lower timeframes. 

Lastly, for the trade setup, here's a look at the 4hr chart:

http://i.imgur.com/SzwUUzY.png

**The measured target** of the break is 0.8000 (give or take 100 pips). 


**Entry:** While I'm already short from 0.9250 on a small size, I will look to add on a retest of the broken neck-line at 0.9100. There's nothing stopping you from getting in short here (or long, I'm not judging) but what will make this trade great rather than average is being able to have as low a risk on entry as possible, allowing a larger position (and larger profits) - and that means getting in on a bounce if possible. I might scale in using up to 5 or 6 small lots, taking advantage of every bounce I can get. However, this requires an increase in the size of your testicles.



**Stop losses** should probably be above the monthly S1 pivot at 0.9160, though I'd be interested to hear where you guys would place your stops? My rationale here is that if we pass this level, the breakout will be a failure and the whole reason for the trade is gone.


**Targets** are simply the pivot levels, which coincide nicely with the areas of demand I've highlighted (black bars). These come in at **0.8935** (Feb 13 low and equal to 2x risk) **0.8800, 0.8550** (monthly pivots) and 0.8010** (the measured target) 


**Time frame** for the trade is 3 to 6 months

Like NZDJPY  higher.  Divergent policy (RBNZ looking to tighten, BoJ easing) is the best reason to be long for me.  Even given risk of sustained USD weakness should the shutdown drag on, debt ceiling get out of hand or FOMC taper schedule continue to be pushed out, it is likely that the NZD will strengthen faster than the JPY would.  This was evident post-FOMC in Sep, NZDUSD rallied harder than USDJPY fell, and USDJPY even made up the fall the next day … After the FOMC no taper announcement, NZDJPY put on 30 points that day, then 130 the next day as USDJPY rebounded.  So not too worried about the USD … 

Earning positive carry also, so no problems if it muddles for  a bit before going higher.

Decent support at 80.00, first stop on the topside around 82.30.  Seems like a good risk/reward at current levels (80.75)

584,2013-10-14,Two Head and Shoulders patterns in the works (EUR/USD and AUD/JPY),"Hey everybody!  Just noticed two H&S patterns on two of my favourite pairs, so I thought I'd share them.

**AUD/JPY** 4 hr chart:

http://i.imgur.com/Ok16FZ7.png


This might not be news to Yen watchers but I haven't really been following this pair lately except for some bad scalping.  Zoomed way out and look what I saw.

It's not the neatest, but it's massive. The neckline comes in at *around* 95.00, which coincides with the 200DMA.  A break targets 102, with other resistance coming in at the dark areas.

Support would come in at the broken neckline, and the current short term trend line (and 55DMA probably) at 94.00 - though if price gets here it's safe to consider the break a failure.

**EUR/USD** 4hr chart:

http://i.imgur.com/oWzNnDc.png

Neckline at let's call it 1.3500. 

Supports come in at the dark areas.  Not labelled here (sorry) so they are 1.344/7, 1.338/40, with the target at 1.3350.

With a stop above 1.36, that's 1:1.5 R:R so not fantastic - but I never said you had to take it ;)

NB for newbies and stuff: it's important to note that the levels mentioned above are vague fuzzy areas where support and resistance might be found. Just because AUD/JPY breaks 95.00 by 4 pips, doesn't mean you should sell your car and go long with a 20 pip stop.  There will be some chop and chug.  

My preferred method of entry is to wait for a pullback to the broken neckline, watch how price behaves, and enter if it doesn't seem able to close back on the other side of it (thus invalidating the break)",8,0.9

587,2013-10-23,Backtest-Analyser 0.1 - Analyse MT4-BTs and get an in-depth view on your trading systems!,"Hello fellow traders, 

I want to share my work with the community (free of charge, of course):


**DARWIN'S BACKTEST ANALYSER**

It takes a normal Metatrader4-Backtest-Report and, based on the single trades within the backtest, does some in-depth analysis of the trading system.
That way, it generates a new backtest report that has a LOT more information about a trading system, compared to a standardt MT4 Backtest.

The tool is and will always be 100% free, it's my way of giving back something to the community from which I have learned so much.
Also, I know that my tools will be much better if I get bug reports/feature requests/feedback from the community.


**Here are some features:**

* It generates almost all statistics that the normal metatrader4 report shows you PLUS MORE
* It generates statistics both on a per-Dollar and on a per-Pip basis
* It can show you how the performance of a system changes over time (for example each year can be saparately looked at in a nice bar chart, and even the performance-fluctuations on a per-month basis is visualised)
* It also allows you to compare the short and the long side of your system, to identify asymetric (and therefore unsound) trading strategies
* It gives you an insight in how your profits on a per-trade basis are distributed (how many of them made, for example, a small loss? how many ""very profitable"" trades were there? etc.) This is all shown in a distribution-graph
* It can also do the same distribution analysis on a per-month basis, and for example show you how many months made how much profit.


All you have to do is, Rightclick on a Backtest-HTML-Report and ""Open with..."" my tool.


* [HERE IS AN EXAMPLE REPORT](http://85.214.116.235/btana_example.html)
* [HERE IS THE DOWNLOADLINK](http://85.214.116.235/Darwins_Backtest_Analyser.rar) (it includes an howto.html that has all informations you need to use this program)
* [GNUPLOT IS ALSO NEEDED](http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html) (when installing, make sure to check 'Add application directory to your PATH enviroment variable')



THIS IS A VERY EARLY ALPHA VERSION, so if you find bugs or have a good feature that you would like to see in future versions, please contact me via PM or in this thread.
Also, at the moment, there is no auto-update functionality, but the program will show you a message when there is a new version available.

I hope you like it and can help me to perfect the tool :)




So long,
Darwin

593,2013-11-07,"Newbie Questions: Leverage, Stop Losses, Holding Trades, Margin Call.","Hi all!

I am very new to forex and I have been using babypips guide to learn the right way of trading. I am hoping I can ask some questions here, thank you all very much.

I am currently using a demo account to trade so I know what is going on. I have not yet learn to read charts because I want to first understand the basics. I am thinking of using $1000 for initial investment to trade.

(1) I need to understand what is leverage. Firstly, I do understand the need of using a leverage.
I use $1000 to control $10,000. A 10:1 leverage. Am I correct to put it this way? If my $10,000 grows 1%, it would become 10,100. That means my initial investment of $1000 has already generated a 10% profit from using a 10:1 leverage as opposed to a 1:1 leverage.

My question is this. Supposed I make a Forex micro account, using an initial investment of $1000, 10:1 leverage, controlling $10,000. Now, 1 week later, I manage to grow my account by 1%. The value now is $10,100. Am I correct to say that I can withdraw $100 from my funds, and now my account remains at $10,000 with my initial investment remain at $1000? If not, how does it work?

(2) Why do I need to use a ""stop loss"" method? I understand about 2:1 reward:risk method. If the trade that I am doing is currently losing, I can hold on to the trade until it profit or breakeven. Is this a bad decision? Please let me know and explain what is the worse scenario that I can face if I do not use stop loss.

(3) Similar to the above question, what is the disadvantages or dangers of holding a trades until it profit?

(4) I need to check again what does it mean by Margin call. Using the Margin Call Exemplified Page from Babypips, I understand that, that is a mini account.

If I were to use a $1000 micro account, using my 10:1 leverage, and I buy 1000 units of EUR/USD at 1.2000

Balance = $10,000
Equity = $1,000
Margin Used = $120
Usable Margin = $880

Am I correct? If not, please correct me.

Using the above example, at what point will a margin call happen?

Thank you all very much!

594,2013-11-08,"Help me to choose a broker -- Oanda, FXCM, forex.com, FXDD","Hi all,  

I posted this thread on a Forex forum, I re-post it here hoping to get more advice.  

I live in China, and I'm a newbie to Forex trading. I plan to deposit 5,000 USD to experiment Forex trading after I get used to the demo account. After I'm OK with 5K USD, I may invest not less than 10K.  

I'm struggling to choose a broker, here are my criteria,  

1, Allow hedging. I'm 100% wanting this.  
Indeed I'm not going to hedge the same amount of money at the same time to earn quick money (which is often used in big news event). What I want to do is, I have a long term position which will be there for several weeks, then I do some short term positions (intraday or several days). That's possible that I have two positions in two directions at the same time.  

2, Money safety.  
During my Googling, I found that some brokers close a trader's account just because he/she earns too much money.  

3, 100:1 leverage. 50:1 is not too bad but 100:1 gives me more flexibility.  

4, Prefer to NDD (ECN or STP), but DD and MM is acceptable if money safety is guaranteed.  

5, Regulates with NFA or FCA.  

6, Support depositing using credit card. This is cheapest way for me, at least cheaper than wire transfer.  

7, Easy to open an account. I prefer to open an account via internet only so I don't need post a lot of certifications to the broker.  

The other points except 1 are tolerant, but I really want point 1 and I think it will be important to me.  

Now comes to the brokers I've done some research on. I've checked a little with Oanda, FXCM, forex.com, and FXDD.  

Oanda, the most money safety one. 50 leverage. However, it doesn't allow hedging.  

All other brokers in my list are not as same money safety as Oanda.  

FXCM, the one that's really annoying me is the margin. Why margin for a lot of EURUSD is $750? That's really weird and is not connected to the real price. Can any one explain to me?  

Forex.com, as big as FXCM, but in the event that ECB put down the interest to 0.25% at Nov.7 this year, a lot of Chinese traders get network error and lost money. That scared me.  

FXDD, not as old as Oanda, and not as big as FXCM and Forex.com, and registered in Malta...  

So, what's your advice of a proper broker for me? The one not on my list is OK too.  

Thanks

EDIT: another disadvantage of Oanda is that they have 6 candles a week, but it's a trivial problem since I can use other broker's MT4 for technical analysis.",4,0.62

http://i.imgur.com/hj77k8i.png

The reaction at the 50% fib of the large decline is playing out beautifully.  Looking to add to shorts between 0.9425 and 0.9500.

Stop around 0.9550 or just above. 

Targets 0.9250, 0.9050


**EUR/AUD**

http://i.imgur.com/lqmCjb3.png

If I take the AUD/USD one I'll go in smaller here, cos I don't want to get double-smashed by a surprise Aussie rally. 

Buy: 1.4160, 1.4100

Stop: 1.4025 (aggressive), 1.3980 (lower return)

Targets: 1.4025, 1.4480, 1.4540


**EUR/JPY**  

http://i.imgur.com/wvp3nr6.png

Price has broken trend line support (several of them actually), but follow through from other Yen crosses is essential for this to be valid.  USD/JPY **MUST** fail at no higher than 99.50 in early monday trading, or this is just a crap shoot.

Price currently testing most likely resistance level (132.40).  133.00 offers a more attractive entry

Stop: 133.80

Targets: 131.25, 130.1

(not really the best R:R)


**AUD/JPY**

I like this one better than EUR/JPY, but again these trades are all about Yen strength, not Euro or Aussie weakness. 

http://i.imgur.com/CmHRrVD.png

Sell 93.00 - 93.30

Stop 93.60 (the reason it's so tight is because if we pass this and end up back in the consolidation area, I don't want to be sitting on this all week seeing if it will carry on down - rather take a small loss and reassess the situation. If USD/JPY breaks 99.50, the momentum will probably carry this thing up).

Targets 92.40, 92.00, 91.00


**USD/CAD**

Entered just below 1.0500 on Friday evening. 1.0505 was the 1.000 extension of the recent up move, and the ""C"" part of an AB=CD patter than has been playing out quite nicely. It is also the channel/wedge top

http://i.imgur.com/nd6jNeu.png

Opportunity for a high R:R short trade on any retests of 1.05 

Stop above 1.0525 or so

Targets: just looking for 1.0400, 1.0350 maybe


**EUR/GBP**

I know I'm probably gonna get mocked for this one, but it's such a simple trade it would be silly to miss it

http://i.imgur.com/Tx1W9Ni.png

Entered long on Friday just above 0.8300, 

Stop below 0.8300 (allow for another test of channel bottom)

Targets 0.8400, 0.8500. I guess you could chance it all the way up to 0.8650, but pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered.

That's all for now! Comments and mockery welcome.

644,2013-12-26,AUD/CAD Technical Analysis. Potential for a long term set up.,"AUD/CAD's recently caught my attention, for a few reasons. Going to attempt some fundies, and then look at some tech for setups.

**The Loonie**

- CAD has taken a thrashing in the last few months, making it the standout in terms of low correlation with just about anything. This is due mostly to Mark Carney's departure and the BOC changing its stance on interest rates from hawkish to neutral. This selling might be overdone.
- This breakdown in correlation is a symptom of a much larger issue - the divorce of price action from risk trends. The weakening in CAD is mostly a result of large funds and corporates deleveraging, and getting rid of their Loonies as quickly as possible to avoid fallout from the above.
- The Loonie is, however, correlated with oil prices
- Goldman Sachs have called for CAD weakness in 2014. [Adam button thinks they're wrong](http://www.forexlive.com/blog/2013/12/23/four-things-the-overwhelming-consensus-believes-in-2014-3-lousy-loonie/) - worth a read if you're trading CAD.

USOil, D1

http://i.imgur.com/AIUxB3f.png

Looks pretty bullish to me. Any serious crisis could spark a lot of volatility, pushing price through the 110 ceiling. It's unlikely, granted, but it's difficult to see a drastic fall in oil demand any time soon. 

**On the other hand, we have the Australian dollar**

- I'm very bearish, but I know the selling is overdone.
- AUD/USD has lost a lot of its correlation with Gold lately, but it still correlates reasonably well to any decent commodities index:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/m6y9Vz7b/

That's not a great chart, but you can clearly see what's happening there. Generally in a downward trending range, which looks rather overbought at the moment. A break to the upside would be extremely bullish for the Aussie, but that's not very likely given rumours of slowing demand from China and a declining gold price.

I know there are a few gold bugs lurking in this sub who are going to argue with me, but I'm pretty bearish on Gold as well.

- I did a [detailed analysis on AUD/USD](http://www.forexlive.com/blog/2013/12/21/the-most-dangerous-game/comment-page-1/#comment-876200) on ForexLive, which explains why I'm so bearish. I'd love to hear your opinions


**So in a nutshell my bias could be summed up as neutral to bullish CAD, neutral to bearish AUD.**

Here's the AUD/CAD daily:

http://i.imgur.com/y5acVLB.png

The top pink rectangle is an absolutely pivotal supply/demand area that has long since been breached. We're currently within a downward channel (much cleaner than AUD/USD's) after failing above the 50% retracement of the year's decline and an attempt to clear this zone. 

The orange line is the 100 Month moving average, but don't get too excited - it hasn't done a great job of providing major support or resistance for as long as I have chart data.

The current channel, if it continues, will bring us very neatly to the rising line connecting the July 2010 and July 2013 lows, as well as a strong demand area, and roughly the 0.382 retracement of the move from 2010 to 2013.

This area is the last chance for bulls. At the point marked with a green circle on my chart I'll be watching price action very carefully. It might take a few days to play out, or it could happen very quickly, but price will probably give us an indication of where it will be heading in 2014 if it gets to that level.

There are two trades:

1. A bounce. I prefer this from a technical perspective, but it doesn't align with my fundamental bias. I'll trade what I see though and if a spike low is formed around this area I will enter long with a stop below that spike, and targeting 0.9700, parity and 1.0500.

2. A break of the 0.9250 area and retest and failure at this level opens up a lot of downside targets - noted in green as fibonacci extensions. If this happens, the challenge will be judging if there is sufficient volatility to give the move continuation, and finding a suitable level to trade against. Downside targets are 0.900, 0.8800 and 0.8600

664,2014-01-19,The Yen pairs & the Nikkei - Week of 19 January,"Hey guys. Been a while since I did an analysis post so I thought I'd do the Yen, since it's fairly active and interesting at the moment. 

I'm going to start with the Nikkei, which I've been shocked to discover not a lot of people actually look at when trading the Yen. Here's a 4hr chart.

http://i.imgur.com/M9Dbjzq.png

Right, so it's pretty clear what's happening there. The original break from last year's consolidation has since formed a trend and broken it twice, each time followed by a triangle or pennant formation. The most recent one actually broke down almost like a H&S pattern, but the buyers came in at that longer term floor. 

The thing to remember about the Nikkei and the Yen crosses is that they are *extremely highly correlated*. They are not the same instruments. The currency pairs tend to follow the movement of the Nikkei, **and vice versa**. Extreme moves from USD/JPY can force similar moves by the Nikkei as much as the other way around.

So, generally what I look for with the JPY pairs is for confirmation (or lack thereof) from the Nikkei. Now, when the Nikkei is closed it can be the S&P doing the moving, and the correlation between EUR/JPY and the S&P is actually quite high as well, but I tend to trade during the Asian session anyway.

**Before I put up some more charts, here's what I think is happening:** A short term high is in place, and we have a range defined in most pairs. USD/JPY, EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY are the most bullish (are forming bullish continuation patterns), while AUD/JPY and CAD/JPY are extremely bearish, should risk unwind significantly. 

I expect USD, EUR and JPY to continue to consolidate for a few weeks within their already-defined triangles. AUD/JPY and CAD/JPY could go either way. 

All charts are 4hr unless I mention otherwise.

So here's USD/JPY 4hr:

http://i.imgur.com/xT67s0R.png

As you can see, I'm short. Not a long term play - just playing the range according to my strategy. Lower high, indicating short term consolidation or at least a short term downtrend. Price tested a trend line defined by two touches, SSD crossed into overbought and back below on 4hr, which is my sell signal when at a trend line. I'll trail the stop soon as possible, cos I'm long term still quite bullish.

My ideal trade here is a long from 103.00 with a tight(ish) stop, AFTER price has at least shown some signs of a bounce. Be wary of placing limit orders, because these pairs love to fake out - especially to the downside.

EUR/JPY, possibly even a better one (4hr)

http://i.imgur.com/PQSWVvB.png

Again you can see I'm short. I took this one first, moved my stop to break even, then took the USD/JPY short. I am bullish here, in the longer term, but the problem is that we have much less of a well-defined support level. Aside from the broken wedge top, and some interim support in along the way.

In order to go long, the best play looks like a break of that bull flag, and buy on a retest. Be wary, as ever, of false breaks. I wouldn't like to try pick a bottom in this correction.

Then, GBP/JPY. I think I like this one the most.

http://i.imgur.com/0ASwSWZ.png

There's some good support coming in at about 168.50 - 169.00. Bear in mind that this pair is not for the faint hearted. Massively wide stops and being fucking right are necessary to trade it profitably. We have the bull flag intercepting the triangle bottom at this level, and the 55DMA might come into play here as well. I really like longs off this area. 

Interestingly, Friday's ridonculous retail numbers couldn't force a break to the upside on this pair, and while GBP/USD enjoyed its time in the sun, this pair's advance was quickly capped at the triangle top by declining stocks.

A break lower, targets 165.00 which is the next major support.  However, I probably wouldn't sell into that. 


**Now I want to look at AUD/JPY and CAD/JPY.**

AUD/JPY first:

http://i.imgur.com/4Ok4rr7.png

Short again :) This was a scalp that was just going so well I decided to hang onto it for the range bottom. Might close it when the market reopens for 70 pips or so. 

Otherwise, I'm not much inspired here. I would be hesitant to buy a bounce off that channel, because it is a *down* channel, and one of my trading rules is never buy the bottom of a down channel or sell the top of a rising one. 

A break lower would **have to be accompanied by corresponding Yen strength**, not just a breakdown in the Aussie. If USD/JPY goes on a tear while the Aussie falls off a cliff, the best case scenario for being short this pair is that it stays flat. To me, that's the most likely scenario.

I'm certainly not going to suggest a buy here either. That's another one of my trading rules: ""never buy the Australian dollar"".

Lastly, CAD/JPY, which I find really interesting.

http://i.imgur.com/sg2pImI.png

Now, I didn't put my MAs on AUD/JPY, but if you put them up you'd notice that EUR, GBP and USD/JPY are all above all 3 MAs, and they're all pointing up. On CAD/JPY and AUD/JPY, it's the other way around. 

Fundamentally I think CAD weakness is a bit overdone, but I'm not going to try pick a bottom just yet. Right now it looks like this pair is headed straight for around 93.70, where its fate will be decided. If that rising line holds, expect at least another retest of the top of the range.

But there's 2 other possible scenarios:

* A proper breakdown, which must be accompanied by similar moves in the other pairs in order to be tradeable.
* A strong reversal from CAD in general, coinciding with USD/JPY, EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY finding bottoms and beginning an impulsive move higher.

The second scenario would be the perfect alignment of fundamental and technical stars, and I'll be watching carefully to see if it plays out. Either way I think longs from around 93.50, with a stop below 92.50, look good.

The very last thing I want to show you is the Nikkei again, and this is just pure conjecture:

http://i.imgur.com/ZS9ixBD.png

That white dotted line is the level price must close above in order to not form the world's most perfect Head and Shoulders pattern. Even still, price MUST exceed the previous high, or a head and shoulders will be in place. Whether or not it plays out, this will make it extremely difficult for bulls to continue pushing price higher, as sell orders will start to mount up.

Just something to think about. Have a good week everyone!",10,0.83

681,2014-02-09,NormanConquest's Guide to the Australian Dollar,"Hey everybody! It's been a while since I did a big analysis post, and I've wanted to do this one for a while. I trade a lot of pairs, but the one I've  gotten to know best over the last couple of years is AUD/USD.

I intend this more as a guide for newbies, but I'd love to hear the more experienced guys' opinions, especially on the fundamentals.

Scroll to the bottom for the charts.

**Fundies**

Australia is a resource economy, with exports and tourism coming a close second. A weaker currency is always better for them. But it's a double-edged sword: it brings foreign capital in, which creates growth and jobs, but also pushes up inflation. 

Which necessitates raising interest rates. Which attracts more foreign capital. Australia has to, essentially, sacrifice price stability and a degree of control over monetary policy for domestic growth. You can see this in the standard of life in Australia:

Everything is expensive. But everyone earns a lot of money too. Salaries are comparatively high, and so is the standard of living. And it's because of all that foreign money that's been washing in for decades - partly the carry trade, partly investment in resources and tourism. 

But the more a weaker AUD helps the economy, the more this pushes up the value of the AUD. Which starts to become an economic headwind.

And so you get some form of competitive devaluation attempt from the RBA, like we've seen recently.

Now, however, the RBA has removed all the dovish rhetoric from its statements, and we are now likely to be able to expect a period of stable rates, followed by a cycle of hikes.

The RBA sees the worst as behind them, and the data should continue to improve, and the Australian dollar along with it. They are satisfied that things are going according to plan.

**Immediate risks (to the AUD, not necessarily Australia)**

The ones I see right on the horizon:

* The god damn unemployment rate http://www.tradingeconomics.com/australia/unemployment-rate
* Inflation http://www.tradingeconomics.com/australia/inflation-cpi
* Verbal intervention by the RBA
* Classic risk-off (not this weird de-leveraging BS we've mostly been seeing)

**Tail Risks**

A tail risk is a risk that is low probability and usually not immediate, but very high impact should it occur. Off the top of my head these ones stand out:

* Resources prices collapse
* China (main trade partner) is a source of considerable uncertainty to the market
* The EM crisis, which is not going away just because USD/TRY fell a bit, could begin to significantly affect Australia
* US Fed tapering could still destabilize markets, or cause significant volatility at least

**Some behavioural quirks**

I have noticed some things in trading AUD/USD, especially this last year, that I feel are worth mentioning.  Couple of things to think about:

* Price is (still) in a now mature and well-established down trend. Momentum on longer time frames is likely to be sluggish for a while yet.
* The AUD attracts carry interest, and given a lack of bearish drivers will usually melt upwards. 
* The market is generally more short than long. That's changed recently, however. Especially since a lot of those shorts were caught on this latest run up. It's 66% longs this week, down from 72% last week as the retail crowd sells this bounce aggressively.
* This creates potential for a short squeeze, but not necessarily a big one.
* AUD/USD loves to squeeze shorts, and it often does so early in the morning in thin liquidy. This can often lead to weak stops getting taken out, and creating many ""false breaks"" above whatever downward trend line you've drawn.

I use sentiment whenever I can - from SSI and stuff, but also just from twitter. I've noticed that when a lot of the more amateur people on my stream start banging on about AUD/USD longs, it's time to sell.

In fact, it is only in USD/CAD and AUD/USD where more traders are net short USD. AUD/USD retail open long positions: http://i.imgur.com/bR4lcl7.png

In the medium term, this indicates that AUD/USD is likely to continue to head lower. However if you're looking to get in on that when it happens, it is extremely difficult on lower time frames. 

**Generally consistent behaviours I have noticed:**

* Significant new lows are aggressively bought more often than followed through. Selling a major break lower almost never works.
* Shorts are squeezed usually beyond the point where short term tech becomes helpful. If you're looking at an hourly chart, you are likely to see major breakouts regularly. These are not reliable signals.
* With this in mind, picking 100% accurate levels to trade against becomes very difficult, regardless of your bias. I generally favour a much longer term approach, scaling in to positions with a very wide stop. Always to the short side.

Let's look at some charts.  Here's the daily:

http://i.imgur.com/lnYAxZk.png

We are currently operating within the downward sloping wedge defined since last year. Trend lines on lower time frames have generally performed badly, with many false breaks in both directions.

I've put the 55 and 100 Daily and Monthly moving averages on here, as these seem to be significant. As you can see, price broke above the 55MA but failed to hold above the 100MMA, a much more significant level. 

I've highlighted two significant supply/demand levels, and price is clearly closer to one than the other. Bears will have a harder time pressing the downside, simply because of this zone from about 0.8500 to 0.8650 or so. 

With this in mind, any break below the Jan 27 low should be treated as suspect, as there will no doubt be plenty of idiots waiting to hoover it up at these levels. 

Zooming in a little to the 4hr chart:

http://i.imgur.com/EkqXxud.png

This makes the technical picture a little clearer. Price carved a slightly rough downward channel for the last part of 2013 before breaking out of it in early Jan. We then tested this broken resistance line 3 times, until a low at the confluence of this line and the larger wedge formation. We now have what looks like a budding Inverse Head & Shoulders forming. 

Price will either break above this resistance line at 0.9000 and hold above, or it will fail here, OR it will break above and then fail. These three scenarios all present trade opportunities.

Looking at a 2hr chart for a bit more detail:

http://i.imgur.com/cRejTOQ.png

Here we can see that the inverse head and shoulders target was hit at the confluence of the 55DMA, 100MMA and the neckline of the potential inverse H&S I pointed out earlier.

Risk:Reward favours shorts at this level, against 0.9085, targeting 0.8750 or below. However, I believe that there is high potential to at least test the upside. A break of 0.9000 on a daily closing basis would be a bad sign. 

However, a break above and failure below this level would create an even better opportunity, as the retail crowd will undoubtedly buy into the break, adding more fuel to a rout if it happens. 

On a sustained break above 0.9000, a dip toward this level should be bought, with a stop below 0.8950 and targeting 0.9200.

Above 0.9200 we have our best opportunity to position ourselves for a greater decline. However, price could squeeze as high as 0.9300 - technically breaking out - before this happens.  

It could well break out and carry on, but I find that scenario unlikely given that the RBA simply will not stand by and allow the currency to appreciate wildly. It would be devastating for the economic recovery, and they have a duty to do what they can to prevent it - even if they claim they won't be fiddling with the exchange rate.

So, the trades are:

**On the short side:**

1) Short/medium term:

Observe Price Action at current levels. Another thing to mention is Daily RSI, which is very far from overbought. However it has come off overbought on the 4hr timeframe, with bearish divergence.

Should we get a test above 0.900 and a failure to close above, sell with a stop above the attempt higher or 0.8090, whichever is higher.

Targets of 0.88 - 0.8750, the Jan 27 low, and 0.8550

2) Longer term:

Begin building a short position on a break of 0.9000, attempting to sell each major rally.

Net stops above 0.9300

Targets of 0.8800, 0.8500, 0.8100

That's my ultimate trade here, but there are plenty of others.

**On the long side:**

1) Price fails here and heads lower right away.

Look for a higher low around 0.8800 - 0.8750 (which might be tricky to spot). This will be the bottom of the right shoulder, should we continue higher. Since this trade is against the larger trend, taking profits when possible should be a focus.

The first exit point is the neckline, which will then be coming in around 0.8900. The position could be added to again on a break and retest of this line. Targets to the upside are the previous swing highs and the wedge top.

2) Price breaks above immediately

Look for a hold of this demand zone. Observe price action throughout January and expect similar things to happen (multiple tests of the broken neckline, each slightly lower than the last).

Finding a level to trade against will be tricky, but I propose 0.8840, since a move to this area would probably negate the neckline break.

Target would be 0.9250 - I think anything above that is a bit ambitious.

**A note on the crosses**

I don't have the time or space to go into EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD here, but they are very interesting creatures.  Couple of things to remember:

* They move much more. Be careful. A 40 pip stop will work on AUD/USD sometimes. It will almost never work on the crosses. Think >140 pips. Don't attempt to trade the short term charts unless you know exactly what you're doing.
* The moves are almost entirely AUD driven. As long as AUD is active, it sets the tone and direction. Nothing the Pound or Euro can do is likely to have a lasting impact. In fact, pure GBP or EUR moves that are counter to the current trend should usually be faded.

684,2014-02-14,My new indicator idea using only the current prices of multiple symbols. Does it look useful?,"My plan for this indicator came from the idea that if you were to convert a currency around through other currencies in a circle back to itself like this:
USD -> EUR -> JPY -> GBP -> AUD -> USD
You should end up with the same amount you started with, if all the currency pairs are perfectly balanced. (assuming no spreads of course)
But for reasons I can only guess at, all those pairs won't always be balanced, sometimes you would end up with more or less USD then you started with.
My theory is that when an imbalance is created in a pair, the market will have no choice but to correct it, thereby possibly acting as a leading indicator to predict things like sudden price spikes, breakouts or trend reversals.

This is the equation I used to measure the imbalance in the EUR/USD value based on their GBP, AUD, JPY crosses.

(EURGBP * EURAUD * EURJPY) / (GBPUSD * AUDUSD * USDJPY) / EURUSD^3

You just need to invert the GBPUSD, AUDUSD prices first.  Here's the code for each spot on the indicator in MQL4:

IndexRatioBuffer[i]=(iClose(""GBPUSD"",0,i) * iClose(""AUDUSD"",0,i) * iClose(""EURGBP"",0,i) * iClose(""EURAUD"",0,i) * iClose(""EURJPY"",0,i)) / (iClose(""USDJPY"",0,i) * Close[i] * Close[i] * Close[i]);

And the file itself incase you want to be confused like me: http://en.file-upload.net/download-8621621/currencyweighttest.mq4.html

I'm still trying to figure out how to make this indicator useful, I had no idea what to expect the results to look like.  The main problem I've run into is that your price data for all those symbols needs to be very accurate and in sync.  I assume it would work best with an ECN broker but all I have is this Oanda demo account.

As you can [see here](http://i.imgur.com/DbMYSni.png) around Feb 2nd the results of the indicator change dramatically as if there was some fundamental change the in way the price data was calculated, but I can't figure out what could be different.  The same thing happens at Feb 2nd in all time frames.  Any ideas what's happening there?

And has anyone seen this tried before? I'd hate to reinvent the wheel.  Or any other ideas how to turn this theory into an indicator?",5,0.78

686,2014-02-16,GBP/USD Technical & Sentiment Analysis (16 Feb 2014),"Hey guys. I don't usually do GBP/USD, but it's suddenly become one of the most interesting pairs in my opinion, because I believe some very big moves are afoot. I'm going to mostly be looking at the long term view in the context of market positioning, so this might not be all that helpful for scalpers ;)

I want to start with the Daily FX SSI (Speculative Sentiment Index) reading for GBP/USD, which is quite something: http://i.imgur.com/pFcbIij.png
(© 2014 DailyFX)


There are 9 traders short for every one long. Basically the entire retail crowd is betting against the trend. This means that the majority of orders in the market will be stop losses near current levels. 

Also worth a watch is John Kicklighter's video for the week, focusing on the S&P and GBP/USD: http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/video/daily_news_report/2014/02/14/Forex_Weighing_Reversals_for_SP_500_USDollar_GBPUSD.html

For those new to this kind of thing, sentiment analysis is just analysis using what you can know about market positioning, and how the market generally ""feels"" about a currency pair. Usually SSI gives quite reliable indications of when a trend will continue, because the majority of retail traders will start betting against it.  Their stops add fuel to the fire when it continues. (This is also why I'm short AUD/USD - 2 traders long to every 1 short. Not extreme yet, but it means there are lots of stops below).

Before I get into too much detail there, here's the weekly chart: http://i.imgur.com/Ef4VRQf.png

(Yes I'm long) 

I've put some tentative levels there, but I'll do more precise ones in a minute. As you can see, price is breaking out of a long term wedge. It hasn't quite cleared the range yet, and 1.700 is a massive wall to get over. There will be enormous interest at this level, not to mention some extremely large option barriers. 

But I think it will break it eventually. Why I think it will go higher? Well, market positioning for one, but also this:

http://www.cityindex.co.uk/market-analysis/market-news/24551832014/sterling-at-fresh-3-year-highs-eyes-more-gains/?cid=0000215115

Good analysis piece pointing out that GBP/USD is only about 6% away from the 200WMA. Deviations from this average have historically been much larger. Since price is clearly moving away from this level, I believe we can expect quite a large move as the market unwinds its short positioning. 

A look at Oanda's orderbook (or the order boards posted at ForexLive) can give us a more precise view of where these orders are sitting:

http://i.imgur.com/FEn4h3O.png

**Current Positioning & Open Orders**

As you can see the market is severely short, mostly from the last 100 pips or so. 1.6600 is an area where a lot of positions, both long and short, were established.

There are clusters of buy stops above 1.6700 (small), 1.6750 (bigger) and then **above 1.6900 there are two large clusters of buy stops.**

Further, there are more buy stops above current price than there are sell orders, meaning that there is ample room for price to continue higher. They're mixed in with some mid-weight sell orders around 1.6800, so this is a level that should provide resistance.

Going a bit lower, we find that bids (both those wanting to initiate new positions and those wanting to take profits on short positions) should provide extreme levels of support.

These are in at about every 10-15 pips between 1.6600 and 1.6500, with the largest cluster being at 1.6500. Going on this alone, buying any dips below 1.66 looks really good.

**Beware the retracement**

Bear in mind that there are **sell stops** below 1.6700 - these are the weaker longs or those wishing to enter short on a break below the figure. These could accelerate a correction down to 1.6650 quite quickly.

Here's the 4hr chart, with the largest bids and offers put in. You'll notice that they line up quite nicely with just about any other method of calculating S&R. Dashed lines are larger orders, dotted ones smaller. The big box is where there are too many orders to make lines for :P

http://i.imgur.com/C1htngr.png

Hopefully that's helpful.


Now, there's also a fundamental component to consider.  The UK's recovery is looking fairly solid, while the market is very quickly losing its patience with the greenback. Over the last quarter my bullish USD bias has evaporated, as it was predicated on the market not having priced in the full effects of the taper. Now that it appears this is not the case, I have no choice but to change my USD bias to neutral/bearish. The recent soft data also indicates that the recovery is lagging that of the UK's quite badly. The market's reaction to positive US data is generally muted, and when something can't rally on good news, it's usually bad news.

Another thing to note is that the DJ FXCM Dollar Index declined throughout the last dip and recovery in the S&P - one of the longest sustained bearish moves in history. It was only half the magnitude of the other declines of this length, but most other 6-7 day consecutive declines in the dollar have preceded much greater bear waves, not recoveries. The logical thing to do is to look for a USD bounce and sell it.

We need look no further than the S&P to see what's happening here:

http://i.imgur.com/YrCT8tA.png (4hr chart with GBP/USD overlaid in white)

Sterling not quite a safe-haven yet. If 1850 goes in S&P, expect GBP/USD to continue higher.  However, Daily RSI on both is currently showing bearish divergence (shown on charts - it's a daily RSI despite it being a 4hr chart)

This means that we might head slightly lower before bouncing. Trend line support for the S&P comes in at around 1775, which would imply quite a serious fall in Cable before buyers really step in.

**The level I really like? 1.6475**  There is a large cluster of buy orders just below 1.6500, which I believe is where the smart money is looking to enter. This move would flush out a lot of weak longs, leaving plenty of space for new positions. Sellers will also be taking a lot of profits off here, giving us a very good chance of a bounce. From there all it will take is a move back above 1.660 to really get moving.

So longer term I would look to start long positions between 1.6600 and 1.6475, with stops below 1.6250 or the 100DMA

Targets would be completely open. I will look to exit the position if and when speculative sentiment drops back to more natural levels, or perhaps even reverses. Stops will be trailed to lock in profit, but not aggressively.

692,2014-02-24,A few questions surrounding Forex.,"
Hello everyone! I have a few questions and I figured this was the best place to start.  I have been using the ForexTrader App on iPad, paired with a few practice accounts, for twelve days now. Spending an average of two hours every day on the app, I have realized ~$18,500 in ""profits"".  I actually have a few major concerns, mainly concerning the ease I have had making money.


To start, I know absolutely nothing about the particulars of the market. I am making *absolutely* no negative comments, nor am I showboating.  I just feel like I am missing a few key components of the market and could really use the guidance. So, without wasting anymore time, here are my questions:

1. In the pair ""USD/JPY"",  just as an example, can one profit, at all, from selling dollars for yen? Does the profit occur if the market sinks? I have seen this called ""going short"", but don't understand the mechanics of it.

2.  Due to my general ignorance of the subject, my strategy has mainly been to buy large, at the top of my $50,000 margin, amounts of a pair close to it's 'low' value and then sell once it's gained a few points. This has been my whole strategy, opening and closing positions within minutes. Is this a bad thing? I have experienced a lot of success, but I don't know if it's ""good"" as a strategy.

3. For a forex mini account, what is the margin offered? My best guess  has been 50:1, but is that constant? Does it increase? It seems like for every $1000 I can control $50k. 

4. If I continue my strategy, does anyone foresee any complications from it? It seems too easy, and that causes me stress.

Thanks anyone who takes the time to read on comment on this, I am really excited to learn more about this subject. Feel free to ask, almost, any questions and feel free to critique/refine my ideas as you see fit. Thanks guys!

So in the market order window I put buy 1,750k and it says it should use 56,000 (used margin), which should leave a 2k usable margin. (and if i lose more than 2k in the trade, itll margin call me, right?)

So when I placed the order.. it says I only used 28,000? (usd margin), and my usable is $28,000?

Phatey with this beautifully simple USD/CHF short: http://i.imgur.com/HDvmumb.png

Congratulations on winning the first /r/forex paper trading competition! I really like this trade because it was just so obvious, clean and textbook, and in the face of all the noise out there about how USD/CHF was on its way to the moon.

There were lots of other good contenders. In second place for sure was Wyat2000's USD/CAD short. The only reason I decided that this didn't win was because phatey's trade had a much better risk/reward ratio - other than that they were both equally good, and equally well executed. 

I didn't include phatey's EUR/USD long, which would have been even better, but I don't believe it was triggered?

Two interesting things:

* Most of the losing trades, and none of the winning ones (except my still-open EUR/CHF long), were against the direction of the prevailing trend and the implications of sentiment readings/positioning (Eg. SSI, COT)
* Ormin also had a sell USD/CHF trade. According to his original stops he was taken out, but Ormin if you managed to stay in it, you're up there with the winners mate. If not, it just goes to show how easy it is to be right at the wrong time.

I'll leave correspondence open for bitchin' and whinin' until the end of the day, so if you have any complaints or suggestions we can pretend that this is a democracy for a bit. Otherwise the prize will be awarded this evening!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Someone suggested we make this a thing, so this is where you post your hottest trade ideas for the week. Smoke 'em if you got 'em, and let's try liven this place up a little.

*** **To make it a little interesting, I will award the week's ""best trade"" with a month of reddit gold!** ***

RULES:

1.  Charts are preferable, but if you don't post a chart then please be detailed about entry level, stops and limits, means of execution, and any other conditions. Vague buy or sell calls won't be considered for the competition - you must include some reasoning behind the trade.
2. In order to be eligible to win, you MUST adhere to Rule #1 and you **MUST post an update on when and how you managed and closed your trade** (including partial exits, trailing your stop, adding on, etc.) - I'm hoping these threads will be a good way for newbies to learn, and for the rest of us to pick up a few tricks.
3. The ""Best Trade"" will be judged by me, but I'll take anyone's thoughts into consideration. It will be based mostly on % change in price during the time the trade was open, but there may be arbitrary style points awarded. Generally it will be on how technically ""good"" the trade is, and hopefully this will generate some debate.
4. Risk management and strategic execution will also factor into it, mostly to try to exclude luck to some degree - but also to encourage and promote good trading habits.
5. You can post trades at any time from now until Friday's close, but no trades after the fact, obviously.
6. Trades that are still open by Friday's close will be considered as closed at that point (unless anyone has a better idea of how to handle this?)
7. EDIT: Forgot to mention that you can post as many different trades as you like, but please do them each in a separate comment to make it easier to track.

I'll post mine as soon as TradingStation is back up tomorrow, but in the meantime, let's hear what you got!",16,0.92

701,2014-03-08,EUR/USD : Trade the breakout,"The comments/targets below are for the week starting 3/9.  Three days ago we closed above 1.38 for the first time since October 2011 (one day last October we closed 1.38009 but if you look at the chart it doesn't pass the eyeball test so I'm not counting that.).  My view has been that we are about to begin a long term breakout so that is my bias.  On the weekly chart below we can see that the price breakout has been confirmed with an RSI breakout and DI- has broken a ~36 month support line.  SOO, while my bias is extremely bullish, we know things don't go up in a straight line and this week may prove to be more down than up.  In fact, I think we are closer to a sell signal than buy.  If we use a pivot of 1.38 we put our resistance for this week ~ 1.3889, and if we use our weekly close as a pivot we get ~ 1.3967 which becomes our sell zone.  1.38 may prove to be support and if that area holds it would target 1.4088 on the upside.  However, I'm concerned about those gaps and thin price action all the way down to 1.3725.  I think it's lower probability, but price could go back down to that area, where we would be aggressive buyers.  So my gameplan is watch for early strength into the sell zone early this week.  Once the sell is generated, taking profits / long building can begin around 1.38.  If we use a pivot of 1.38 our support is 1.3711 so we look around (1.3711 - 1.3725) for an aggressive buy zone.  Buy / sell zones on 4HR chart.  Hope this helps, please contribute thoughts, good luck!!

**And the winner is...**

I'd say that Green_Pips's [awesome NZD/USD long](http://i.imgur.com/04Mksly.png), bagging him 100 pips in return for risking 50, was the clear winner this week. This one was nice and simple, good R/R and it ran all the way to the TP - but not before spiking around a lot. And that's what makes it the winner in my books: unlike most of our other winners which were closed manually, Green_Pips held on to his and it eventually hit his full target - the only trade to do so.

Not to say there weren't some other great trades - FXReddit's AUD short trifecta made him plenty of pips, but I didn't want to start a precedent by considering baskets of trades or average performance :P

So well done to Green_Pips and all the other winners, and if you weren't one - there's always next week!

My problem is I don't quite know the lingo and have yet to determine if I can make trades in a specific way that is presented in one of my books. So here's an example:

let s say I have 1 USD and we have all these other rates  1USD=50indianRupees, 50Indian rupees=2JPY, and 1 JPY= 0.05 USD. Then if I make a chain of buys: 1 dollar buys 50 ruppes which buys 4JPY which buys 0.05 USD; calculating:

     50*2*0.05=5USD, a profit of 4 dollars.

Basically my question is, is it possible to trigger a sequence of trades like this. From what I have read, in this example there are direct and indirect quotes and cross currencies, but what i really want to know is can I use an algorithm to trigger a sequence of trades like this?

Thanks for reading.",3,0.72

This pair is driven heavily by interest rate differentials, a good correlation exists between the 2y swap spread or the 1y1y spread between AU and NZ.

RBNZ has a fairly steep interest rate track priced in, with 4% expected (possibly another 25bp hike) by end of 2015.  

RBA is moving back towards a more neutral bias going forward, however there are obviously risks regarding raw material prices moving lower (iron ore is a big one), and Chinese slow down concerns.  

Market positions seems to be fairly stretched, albeit it has been twice what it is now late last year and earlier this year (probably as hedge funds shorted Aussie in response to the RBA cutting cycle and China).  This is based of CFTC currency futures positioning, so it's not a perfect method by any stretch.

This is obviously a longer term trade, with ideal entry back towards 1.0550 rather than the 1.07ish level we're trading at now.

i can think of so many more, just elaborate on how your day goes


I'm a uni student so i usually go through news (forexfactory) in class, right after i look at naked charts(only trade eu/usd) and see if i can tell the trend for the different timelines and add a M.A. of 200 to help me, set up a trade if possible( 2% risk, -20:+60 pips), if important fundamentals i setup 2 way trade(short and long) 20 pips from current price with tight SL and once a direction is taken reinforce that trade by adding to the position. My end goal is to reach 25% a month and if i do, I stop trading for the month (never reach). I do not scalp currently as my confidence is not the greatest yet( had a major loss some years ago) but plan on scalping


Im really interested in knowing how the day of someone that lives of this is and how did it all start, is the stress real?

Here's an example on NZD/USD

The price reached a previous SR level and we saw a bullish harami at this level. Not a very strong PA signal but still worth checking since the price is at such a strong zone.

Now if you go to a 4 hr chart.

Here we see a nice bullish morning star patter at the resistance zone but at the same time the price is really close to the previous resistance zone on the 4 hour. chart.  And in fact as we can see after the next candle it reaches that zone.

These type of salutations(when we have opposite SR zones on different time frames) really confuse me. I didn't take the trade here since harami is not a strong bullish signal but still what would one do if we did see a stronger bullish signal there on the daily chart.

769,2014-05-09,"Russia, Ukraine, and Forex Trading","Adapted from my blog. Original post May 2, 2014.

One of the biggest advantages of trading forex is that global political events often turn themselves into excellent market opportunities. Take, for instance, the turmoil in Ukraine. As the instability in that region grows, and capital flows out of Russia seeking safer havens, such opportunities are on the horizon. If you’re not familiar with what has been happening there, here’s a brief rundown of the past few months.


**Putin Outplays the West**


February 22nd- Ukranian President Viktor Yanyukovich is removed from office and flees the country.

March 21st- Following weeks of protests for secession, Russia annexes the ethnically Russian Ukranian region of Crimea. The US immediately sanctions several prominent Russian politicians and business leaders.

April 4th(ish)- Russia masses 40,000 troops on Ukraine’s Eastern border.

April 25th- Russia raises the ruble’s interest rate to 7.5%.

May 2nd- Ukrainian army forces clash with pro-Russian separatists in the Eastern cities of Odessa and Slovyansk.


**What Happens Next?**


Amid all the sabre-rattling and mindless media coverage, one can discern a pattern to Russia’s behavior in Ukraine that has been used recently in other conflicts. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia and all but annexed the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossettia. Putin then employed a similar strategy of fostering political unrest before invading the region to ‘liberate’ ethnic Russian populations, and repeated the process in Crimea. It stands to reason he will do so again in Ukraine’s industrial, and Russian speaking east.

This is assuming Putin doesn’t fear the threat of economically damaging and sweeping sanctions from the West. After all, Russia’s largest exports – oil and natural gas – have willing buyers in India and China, if not Eastern Europe. Putin has been in power for 14 years in Russia – long enough to turn his gaze beyond domestic squabbling and toward a more global stage, and the short term pain these sanctions would cause may not be enough to deter his advance.


**So Where Is the Trade?**


There are two outcomes I see as likely. Both offer excellent trades in the near future.

1) Russia invades Ukraine, or continues to support pro-separatist rebels in the east. This prompts expansive Western sanctions on May 25th and the ruble continues its decline. Investors will flock to more stable, high-yielding currencies like the NZD and to a lesser extent the TRY (whose issues will pale in comparison to the ruble), providing extended carry-trade opportunities for speculators.

2) Russia somehow avoids Western sanctions and looks to attract foreign investment once more with the ruble’s tasty 7.5% interest rate. Short USD/RUB will become an attractive mid-term trade as the ruble bounces back from its long decline of early this year.

Either way, opportunity is on the horizon! We will certainly be keeping an eye on the events in Ukraine to determine where best to invest our capital, and will keep you updated on the blog and twitter as the situation unfolds.

Agree with my analysis? Disagree? Let's hear it, r/forex!",4,0.68
770,2014-05-10,Alright trade ideas thread for next week! How did you do this week.,"So this week some important stuff seems to be getting resolved. I like selling the euro on rallies at this point. After strong rejection above the multi-decade trend line, and all sorts of rumors about QE or rate cuts out of euro I think others will have the same idea. I really want to wait for the first week of June (Before next ECB presser) to put on a long term short (3 or 4 months) on the euro. probably against the dollar. 

I like USDJPY pair for next week because were getting close to a major trend line support area. If we break a large run through 100 could be expected. if we start quietly creeping over 102 I think will see another run for 104. basically like the pair because a triangle resolution seems near. 

AUD/USD is clearly giving zero shits about China and all things iron ore. I like the carry trade here too. But I really REALLY want to wait for a good pull back to get long. we get RBA minutes in two weeks, and cash rate in 4 weeks. I am putting odds for a rate hike at 75% for this meeting. Last inflation read was 2.9% which is higher then current cash rates.

773,2014-05-12,What do you think of this cross currency pair strategy?,"I'm basing this on the premise that the price of cross currency pairs is entirely dependence on their respective USD pairs.  Say you wanted to trade EUR/JPY, would it be better to ignore the EUR/JPY chart and instead apply whatever strategy you use to EUR/USD and USD/JPY, and then only enter a EUR/JPY trade when your strategy indicates that EUR/USD and USD/JPY will move in the same direction?

EUR/JPY = EUR/USD x USD/JPY

This equation holds true at all times no matter what.  So if both USD pairs go up, then EUR/JPY goes way up.  If one USD pair goes up and the other is flat, EUR/JPY goes up a little.  If one USD pair goes up and the other goes down, EUR/JPY is flat.

Let me do some abstract statistics to show the benefit of this strategy.  Let's say you have some strategy that produces winning trades 60% of the time with a 1:1 risk/reward ratio.  Wait until your strategy says to enter a trade in the same direction with both USD pairs, but instead enter EUR/JPY in that direction.

Originally you would have a 36% chance of winning both USD trades.  A 48% chance of winning one and losing the other.  And a 16% chance of losing both.  Converting this to what would happen if you instead did a EUR/JPY trade, ignore the trades that break even, your win loss ratio is now 69.2%, almost doubling your profit margin from the previous 60%.

So anyway, is this strategy legit?  What are the downsides?",1,0.56

785,2014-05-29,AUD/NZD,"Hi guys.

a while back i mentioned this cross when we were about 1.06 - 1.07.  It's really starting to look like it'll break into a new 1.09 - 1.12 range so i've gotten a decent long on here (1.0940).  Could be a false break as we haven't quite made fresh highs, but i think it's worth a crack.

Let me know if you've got any thoughts.  This view is part technical (the range break) but also fundamental in that NZ interest rates are getting squeezed lower right now inline with offshore moves.  this cross is very sensitive to interest rate differentials, and australia has only limited space to flatten where as the kiwi curve has a much steeper shape to it, giving it more room for the Aus/kiwi differential to come in, pushing this higher.

The major players in this market are the major global banks. Financial centers around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range emits several types of buyers and sellers all day, except weekends. The foreign exchange market determines the relative values ​​of different currencies.
What Is Foreign Exchange Trading

The foreign exchange market operates through financial institutions, and it works on several levels. Backstage Banks turn to a small number of financial institutions called ""agents"" who actively participate in large amounts of foreign exchange. Most traders are banks, although this market behind the scene is sometimes called the ""interbank market"", although some financial insurance and other companies involved. Transactions between agents of change can be very large, including hundreds of millions of dollars. Because the issue of sovereignty when two currencies involved, Forex has little (or no) supervisory body regulate their actions.

Example: A popular pair that is widely marketed is the EUR / USD. The EUR / USD pair is the European dollar, also known as the EURO and USD, which is the U.S. dollar. When the euro becomes worth more money in dollars, the torque increases, when it becomes a lower value of money in dollars, the fall in the value of par.

801,2014-06-18,Trading the BoE minutes,"The meaning of mental control and money management is something that is always at the top of my head, but after trading for 12 hours straight, without making a profit, I was getting frustrated and bothered. I just saw yet another USD/JPY trade cancel out into nothing, and the minutes were coming up.

So I dipped my toe. Following the news eagerly. When I thought I had the hang of it, the trade turned on me. Not ten pips, not twenty, but 200 pips. 

""Shit"", I thought to myself. ""I made nothing today, and now I'm even gonna lose this monster-chunk of pips? What I've worked for all week?"", so I double up. Yep. Martingale. I even changed directions. My mind was a wreck, my self-esteem was a wreck, and the fear of destroying all my gains was nagging me.

This time, I was fortunate. I ended up 10%, but could just as well have ended up down 50%. This was a horrible decision, and I want to share it with all of you. 

Why? Because I usually keep myself to a maximum of 5% drawdown per trade. Even that is a lot. Now I went crazy. I went out on a limb that could break and obliterate all my gains, just to make back what I lost on an already stupid decision.

Reasons:

1)SUPDEM zones being tested for second time with only a MINOR retrace bouncing off another Supdem zone. 

2) Fundamental Analysis points toward a bullish trend for AUDUSD. (See forex factory calendar and bloomberg). 

3) Trading a break out...not my favorite. It's hard to get an Engulfing candlestick in this shit volatility. 

4) Flipped my trusty coin and it said bullish. 

5) H4 chart shows Lower time frame supdem zones. Notice that i put my SL below the previous supdem zone WITH breathing room. Remember to move SL up at 50% or 75% to TP. (I normally move SL to breakeven at 75%). 

6) Expected time to finish? Seeing how great this volatility is? Probably when we have flying cars. 

7) Questions? Ask. High chance of troll reply.

EDIT:
---- 

TP hit. It's retracing as expected back to the supdem zone it broke. I will reenter long in that zone if it forms an engulfing candlestick on the H1 or H4 timeframe. Note that there was a catalyst that made AUD drop right from the .9500 zone. One being a psychological level, and another being an economic release (which isn't that big of a deal). ",1,0.53

IMO there is good confluence on either side to justify a trade.   
I think the most likely result would be dollar strength (possibly after the ECB and before NFP, or in the first few minutes after NFP). I expect any dollar strength to be fleeting though and I believe it should be faded specifically against the EUR, CHF and JPY (less confident). But you should be wary if we see a number above +275k jobs then you might want to be more careful. I would avoid the AUD and NZD at this point.    

The corresponding levels are as follows:    

Dollar Index : Short 10410  
EURUSD: Long 1.3626  SL1.3595 www.tradingview.com/x/uWLsZant

If USD weakness is seen after the news, I would personally stand aside and wait for levels that are slightly further off. If this is the case and there is interest I will post the levels (Somewhere around USDX 10330 EUR 1.38, JPY 101.75).  These levels would also be good TP levels for the trades mentioned above, but I will post more refined TPs if this plays out as planned.
Lastly, if you take these DO NOT allow yourself to get whipsawed. It will be messy.  

Edit: Speaking of messy, the Aud is really screwing up the USDOLLAR, so be careful. My trade is the euro for now.

829,2014-07-21,"How I earned $5,000 using Fundamental Analysis","Hi Forex traders, 

I tried quite a few forex systems and found that most of them work only during certain market conditions, so when the market changes the system stops generating profit. 

Obviously, as a result I lost some money, luckily not much! 

What I also found, that like with ordinary medium-to-long term investing, if you just pick an asset that appreciates in value over time and hold it, you can actually profit with even less risk and stress. Translating this strategy to the forex world - just ""identify the trend and follow it"". 

Surely, to prove the strategy you need to hold onto it for at least several months, so I decided to track any fundamental factors I find, so I could then at least have some fun sharing them with friends (yes, waiting is quite boring). 

I kept adding fundamental analysis factors, trade ideas and market events I used during my journey. Now my portfolio grew to almost **$8,500** using only **$3,000** deposit - I am sure I couldn't do it without tracking all the fundamental factors that gave me confidence and belief that I am doing the right thing.
I am still enhancing my strategy but for me it works pretty well. 

And here is my simple portfolio:

**Profit : +$8,410** (as of 21 July 2014)

Currency Buy/Sell Size Traded Price Current Price Profit

EUR/USD  Sell    100,000   1.3991   1.3531     +$4,600

841,2014-08-01,USDJPY - Still bearish? Mid-Term analysis,"Daily entry: https://www.tradingview.com/x/UrR0xl3o  

For the past months I have traded the pair as a range trade with a bearish bias targeting 99.40 as a minimum. There has been a massive confluence at that level and below to the low 98s which is hard to ignore.  

Although this week we broke the triangle upwards, I am still of the belief that we are simply widening the consolidation. The simple fact is that every extension I draw leads to a short term move that ends below the 105.43 highs. So unless we grind towards 105 while maintaining divergence, then effectively break out, this should be bearish and merely a squeeze.  
 
So this leads to the question, where to get short?  As seen in the chart, we have hit and slightly bounced from the minimum 1x extension at 103.031, but the shorter term price action suggests possibly higher (as well as R:R) (I am actually looking to buy on the hourly). So I will begin to enter the market short at the 1.236x extension at 103.50. I could see price possibly going as high as 104.25 if stretched into more of a channel than a triangle. Therefore I will initially place stops on this trade at 104.60.  
Potential take profit depends on how high the extension goes, but from 103.50 - suggests that 99.40 will continue to be a minimum target giving a R:R of 3.72.  

Daily Preliminary TP: https://www.tradingview.com/x/TycmrdOF   


Nikkei: The Nikkei has a high correlation with UJ due to the interaction of cash with equities. Similar to UJ, the Nikkei has all bearish extensions while below the 16300 highs.  
https://www.tradingview.com/x/rjxhMJk7  

I am of the opinion that there are much better currencies to play strong yen off of than the USD, but the USD is the most clear at the moment. If something else shows to be more clear, I may split the trade in multiple parts when it comes time.  

Edit: Due to the more immediate bearishness of the pair (from the 1x extension), the structure has changed but remains bearish as of today. The levels have changed but no longer leave a confluent level.

885,2014-09-12,Dollar Index ($DXY vs USDOLLAR),"Mostly out of curiosity how many of you look at the Dollar index relative to other pairs you trade and what kind of weighting do you put on the strength (or weakness) that it shows? Also any interesting observations?

It isn't something I've ever paid much attention to, though I understand how it can be useful for correlation/volatility?. I also notice there are two main Dollar Indexes, the $DXY which is what my broker offers, and then the USDOLLAR which more popular brokers such as FXCM offer. 

The difference between the two is the weightings that make up the index: 

$DXY: 

    Euro (EUR), 57.6% weight

    Japanese yen (JPY) 13.6% weight

    Pound sterling (GBP), 11.9% weight

    Canadian dollar (CAD), 9.1% weight

    Swedish krona (SEK), 4.2% weight

    Swiss franc (CHF) 3.6% weight

USDOLLAR: 

    Euro (EUR), 25% weight

    British Pound sterling (GBP), 25% weight

    Japanese Yen (JPY), 25% weight

    Australian Dollar (AUD), 25% weight

So I'm also curious as to which of the two may be more 'reliable', as today the USDOLLAR has made a new weekly high today whereas the $DXY weekly high was made on Tuesday (which in a way better represents today's lack of volatility).

886,2014-09-13,My experience with Rob Booker's Trifecta system,"Hey guys. Haven't posted in a while, since I've been trading in a slightly different way lately and haven't been doing much classical TA. 

Just wanted to share my thoughts on a system I thought I'd try a few months back: Rob Booker's Trifecta system.

Now, Rob runs the tfl365.com website, which broadly speaking offers 2 things: The Trifecta course (about $27 all in) and a monthly subscription service to his trade alerts and the community, etc. (which I think is also $27/month). 

In very basic terms, he teaches a simple strategy, and then coaches people to use it. His following is not massive - about 2,500 traders using it he says. At first I was very sceptical, because he seemed like an internet snakeoil salesman. But his honesty in being a sleezy internet salesman is refreshing. He will happily share how much money he makes from TFL (Trading For a Living) and how much from trading. He shares his losers as well.

The strategy, (and Rob doesn't mind us teaching it to other people if we really want to) is as follows:

1. Get his custom indicators. There's 2 of them. One of which plots all daily, weekly and monthly pivots that have ever been on the chart, and marks which ones were ""missed"" on the day/week/month they were formed. These are important, because he noticed ages ago that when price misses a pivot because it is moving strongly in one direction, it has a tendency to retrace towards that pivot when that driver runs out of steam. Relative to the time frame we're talking about
2. The other indicator is basically a combination of several oscillators. Not really important what they are, but I think it's RSI, SSD and MACD or something. It prints a signal on the chart when price is divergent from all three. This indicates that the trend in question might be becoming exhausted.
3. When you see that divergence signal, AND there is a missed pivot below/above price (depending on if it's been going up or down), you draw a trend line under/over price and trade the break of that trend line, towards the pivot that was missed.
4. Use 15m charts for daily pivots, 1HR or 4HR charts for weekly pivots and 4Hr or daily charts for monthly pivots.
5. Generally the targets are about 15-25 pips for the short term stuff, and anywhere up to 500 pips or more for the longer term trades.

The system has a fairly well documented success rate of 65% (depending on which minor variant of the strategy you're using - it gets more detailed), but then he added a feature that is often found in EAs, and the trading activities of banks: not using stops.

It sounds a bit dangerous, and it can be if used improperly, but all you do if a trade moves against you is that you wait for another setup, usually on the 15m chart, and when that happens you take the trade again in the same direction, same size.

The idea is to trade very very small, so that a massive move (500 pips for most pairs) would only be a small loss (2-5%), giving you ample room to wiggle out of the trade. Once it goes against you, the only concern is getting out with no loss. 

 **How it's worked for me:**

So far, so good. I saw good consistent gains the first 2 months I used it. Remarkably consistent actually. About 4-6% per week for about 9 weeks in a row. Which was encouraging. Then, however, I got a bit cocky and went in way too big on a long NZD/USD trade about 2 months ago, and I've been fighting my way out of it ever since.  But that was really my own fault. There's no reason I should have ended up in a position where I had a loss so big I couldn't manage my way out, if I had been following the rules.

Anyway, I encourage you to check it out, or ask any questions. If anyone's interested I can post a chart with what a setup looks like.

The indicators are free (you can find them on his website), and technically there is no reason you can't use his strategies without paying him money. But I made back the $27 in one or two trades, so I'm not fussed. Watching his videos and talking to other Trifecta users has a lot of value though. Rob himself is quite active in the community and always happy to answer questions. In general he seems like a really nice guy, if sometimes annoyingly enthusiastic. He'll happily give you advice on a trade, even if it's not one of his.

911,2014-09-25,My view on FXCM's new 'ECN' and spreads,"Its math...

1 STANDARD LOT (no slippage, perfect execution)

EUR/USD
Broker 1
1-1.3 spread

Broker 2 (FXCM)
0-.3 spread
$8 round trip

Spread difference 1-1.2 pips, that's $10-13 that Broker 1 makes with the markup

Broker 2 (FXCM)
$8 round trip for 1 standard lot 0-$3 on the spread. That is $8-$11 that FXCM takes in

As you can see, the difference is very small. And unless you trade 100+ lots a month your not going to see any real noticeable difference that you couldn't make up with better execution on a trade.

This goes with my theory that its all psychological, it may look like your getting a better deal, but with an $8 round trip its still pretty close. ICMarkets gives discounted round trip rates of $5.50, with the same spreads or even less if you use cTrader. 

FXCM is basically offering the same product just in a manner which will attract more customers that blindly say lower spread = better. Lower spread is only better if they are not charging for round trip charges.

FXCM is the same as a .8-1.1 spread on 1 standard lot. Yes its lower, but with slippage and the natural fluxuation of the spread price by a few tenths of pips, its basically the same. You would be better sticking with a broker that gives you better execution speeds and has better service.

To me, if you do lots of volume or scalping you should look at execution instead of focus solely on spread. The spead is only a few dollar difference either way. However, poor execution can hurt you a lot more than spread. As well as other things like data feed freezing (ICMarkets for example) and other factors should be looked at harder. 

Of course you want to make sure the spread is not outrageous, but if its in that 1-1.5 range (non ecn) or (0-.5 range for ECN). Then if the $1 more your paying to the broker (1 standard lot) is gonna break your trade... then you need to trade better. The other factors like trustworthiness, customer service, withdraw times, funding options, data feed reliability, and execution carry far more weight in my opinion. The ""sheep"" the '90%' that fail as retail traders pay far too much attention to spread in my opinion.

Its all psychological, they are doing it to get more of the uneducated traders to come to them because they have a better spread. This should increase their business. When I first started out I thought too that ""lower spread is better"". However after experiencing different brokers,trading and researching I learned that spread is a very small piece of the pie in the bigger scheme. Especially if you do large amounts of volume or large trades. 

When I trade with ICMarkets, I would get a 0.2 spread on average with MT4, but I would regularly be slipped .5-1pip on my trade. Just food for thought, low spreads should not be your deciding factor for choosing a broker. Use your brains people and do a bit of math. You will see that even though its offered in different manners, all the brokers still get about the same money from you with each trade, some just take more than others.

For years I had been using oanda to convert USD to EUR for my own use (I earn in USD and spend in EUR). I'd wire in from a US bank, watch the rates for a few hours/days/weeks, then convert at an opportune time and wire it out to a European bank. Amounts typically in the US$10K range.

A week ago they blocked my account, saying they no longer supported this type of transaction. I called and asked if I could get it reinstated by doing a few trades along the way, and they followed up with an email saying ""no"".

Sadly for me, I can't find any other replacement that's anywhere near as cost-efficient.

Quote from xe, usforex, and transferwise are in the region of 1% less favorable than oanda's rates. For example the other day oanda gave me €15856 for $20000, whereas when I checked the same minute on transferwise, they were offering to give me €15727. This really adds up.

Is there someone else who will let me do this without charging an arm and a leg? Or is there a way to get back in oanda's good graces?",3,0.72

I need some money immediately (~30-50k). The rest I'm ok leaving but would love to have it all with me in USD sooner rather than later. I have no plans to live in Canada again.

Should I...

1) Pull the 30-50k from CAD to USD now and leave the rest in hopes for a better rate.
2) Pull it all now and take the exchange hit (~15k at the moment).
3) Leave it all hoping for a rate closer to 1:1 within the next year, and sell a few US investments to fund me for now.

I feel like a lot of USD selling will appear since the knee-jerk reaction to change is often to pull your positions until the picture becomes a little clearer.  Especially now that it would be so tempting to take profits and avoid the risk.  But once I consider the political change, the picture gets muddier for me.  On one hand, having a Republican legislature opposing a Democratic president should lead to more political instability and infighting.  But then if both houses are of the same party, legislation might have a better chance of getting out of Congress and could this be seen as a stabilizing factor?

Let's say that there are the following prices - for 1$ you get 46.0 RUB, and for buying 1$ you need 46.5 RUB. Now, I imagine that if I wanna buy this pair, first of I'm gonna need RUB so I can buy dollars. So I'll exchange 200$ which would get me 9200 RUB. So, for buying this pair, I'm gonna have to exchange back those RUB in Dollars, which would first mean a loss (9200 RUB would mean 197 point something $). So I keep on waiting and the RUB goes down and after a week there are the following prices : selling 1$ gets you 50 RUB and for buying 1$ you need 50.5 RUB. Now I want to close the order, so I sell those 197$ and I get 9850 RUB, which is 650 RUB more than I started with. But this is 5$ less than i started with, because now 9850 = 195$. 

Now, my demo account has 1:100 leverage and as I said, I had 1000$ on it. I bought this pair 2 days ago when 1$ = 46.1 RUB (size was 0.20) and closed the order yesterday when the 1$ reached 48.2 RUB. It seems I made a profit, because my balance went up. Obviously it's fine for me, but I want to understand how it works. What did I get wrong?

Is there news coming from Australia that would have provoked such a devaluation of the Australian dollar? Or was there a 'technical indicator' that pointed everyone in the same direction to sell.

1004,2014-11-21,Question around the concept of leverage,"Hi all,

As I'm sure you'll figure out quickly, I'm new to this..started demo trading last week. I'm just a little confused in regards to the concept of leverage. I'll explain this hypothetical situation, and would really appreciate some clarification.

Let's assume my account has $2000 of funds in it, and I'm using 50:1 leverage. I decide to go long USD/JPY at the market rate of 117.629. 

100,000 dollars * 117.629 = 11,762,900 yen

Let's say the my stop loss triggers at 117.600.

100,000 dollars * 117.600 = 11,760,000 yen

So 11,762,900 yen (original) - 11,760,000 yen (close) = loss of 2900

loss of 2900/117.600 = loss of $24.66

Do all my calculations account for leverage? Here's where I'm confused..am I really able to enter such a large trade, set a stop loss, and only risk losing $24.66? Or is there something I'm missing?

If I setup an account with say Oanda, and my base currency is in USD, if I place an order for EUR / GBP, it appears to let me place that order. I assume that to do so, it is first making a market trade between UDS / EUR, and when I close my trade it does the reverse and I absorb the spread.

Additionally, if I wanted to trade EUR / GBP, but rather than making that happen via USD -> EUR -> GBP, I wanted to take a route like USD -> CAD -> EUR -> GBP, is that at all possible for me to execute?

Here’s the indicators it uses

PZ Support and Resistance Indicator

http://www.pointzero-trading.com/FreeMetatraderDownloads/view/28

Also uses Zig Zag and the MACD 

The MACD settings is 36 32 19

So far I get over 80% wins on both the long and short positions. But this is the bugs I need worked on 

 #  My EA enters the trades too early, often over 1 dat too early and gets decent size drawdown before it makes a small profit. Price goes against the EA 100% of the time on the first day. 

 #  Doesn’t make that much profit per trade often under $100 on a 100k lot size. It doesn’t take full advantage of the move 

 #  It sometimes opens trades and doesn’t put in a SL or TP, it does close trades based on support and resistance so not sure if that’s why it doesn’t enter values sometimes for TP and SL. 50% of the time it automatically enters the SL and TP but not all the time. 

 #  It breaks even allot where it opens a trade real quick and closes for a zero profit or loss 

If someone can help me fix this EA I’d greatly appreciate it. I think this EA has allot of potential since it rarely losses trades. 

What’s weird when I backtest this EA it losses allot but in forward testing it wins most of the time, is that unusual? When my programmer backtest the EA it wins most of the time, but on my MT4 platform it doesn’t perform the same as my programers in backtest only.

Being a whole new person interested in Forex (and doing pretty well on a demo account I may add): I came across a website called ""Trader's Way"". It interested me quite well. Mainly because of what they've advertised.

Here's the website for Trader's Way: http://100.tradersway.com/

Here's what their website claims:
    - Low spreads as low as 0 pips
    - Minimum $1 deposit
    - ECN account for minimum $10 deposit
    - 1:1000 leverage
    - Minimum order size of 1 micro lot
    - Scalping and hedging allowed
    - 100% bonus up to $5,000 USD

So, my question is... **Is this for real? Am I just being sceptical? Is there something I should be aware of?**

If there are people out there who have tried or have knowledge on these types of companies that provide these ""best trading conditions possible"" types of deals - **please let me know if they're actually worth it.**

Sure, it's $10 USD I can try. With a 1:1000 leverage, **I'd probably lose it in no time.**

**And for those experienced traders out there, let me know what's your take on this! As a beginner, some of you may hold invaluable information. Your responses are very much appreciated!**

Shortly after the bottom in the RUB had been put in, I started to see brokers sending out emails saying that trading in RUB was being suspended. 

What generally happens in this situation if you are in the market when your broker suspends a pair? Is your position closed at the price when they suspend? Do they leave it open, but deny you access to it to manage it? 

It occurred to me it might be interesting to hear from anyone who was brave enough to get involved, and also to have some idea of the risks that might be present should something similar happen in RUB (or another currency) at some point in the future!

I just closed my first trade today, for a profit of 125 pips on a counter trend trade on the USD/JPY.  I'm over the moon that this is finally happening, that I've taken the plunge.

I'm not associating this win with me being perfect- there WILL be ups and downs to be taken in stride- but at least now I have my boots on the ground, and hit the ground running.

1080,2015-01-14,Volatility and weak oil continues to dampen sentiment as ECJ judgement looms,"Market Overview

Volatility remains high on global financial markets and this means that traders and investors are getting thrown around on a daily basis. The commodity story is a major cause for concern as the oil price continues to plummet and with metals such as copper also falling 5% on the day there are considerable questions over a lack of demand that are plaguing markets. Safe haven plays have done well in recent days and the classic safe haven currency, the yen has significantly strengthened. Volatility indices such as the VIX are back on an upward trajectory which is also not positive for equity markets, which have a negative correlation. Into today there will also be nerves over the European Court of Justice which gives a ruling over the legality of the ECB’s life support programme the European Stability Mechanism, which was put in place as a backstop after Mario Draghi pledged to do “whatever it takes” to save the Eurozone. Depending on the outcome, hopes of the implementation of QE could be dashed today.

Wall Street had a rather wild session, having been strongly higher and then strongly lower, markets closed only slightly weaker with the S&P 500 down by 0.3%. Asian markets have also struggled overnight as the World Bank cut its forecasts for global growth in 2015 from 3.4% to 3.0%. With the strengthening of the yen, the Nikkei has also come under pressure and was down 1.7%. European markets are responding to the overnight selling pressure and are sharply lower in early trading.

In forex trading, there has been a safe haven shift. The yen is the main beneficiary, with the commodity currencies (Aussie, Kiwi and Canadian Loonie) all under pressure. It is interesting also that both the euro and sterling continue to consolidate against the dollar.

The main news today is the ECJ announcement, but there is also US Retail Sales to consider at 13.30GMT. The consensus forecast is for a slight month on month gain in December of +0.2% (versus +0.7% in November, which did though contain Black Friday). Bank of England governor Mark Carney is also due to speak at 14.15GMT about the Financial Stability Report which may have an impact on sterling.

1112,2015-02-12,Forex Fundamental Analysis -- a noob watching the Central Banks,"Hello traders. I'm just starting to watch ForexFactory and data releases in order to understand the way a Central Bank feels about their currency. After reading the follow-up articles on Bloomberg and Reuters, I've made notes about expected strength or weakness, and tried to keep it as short and simple as possible.

I'd appreciate comments from other fundamental traders, whether you agree or disagree with my analysis.

EUR (0.05% interest rate)

* ECB is planning 1 trillion EUR spending (approx. 60B/month) to boost growth and inflation

* stimulus will increase money supply and weaken currency

* outlook is DOWN



USD (0.25% interest rate)

* FOMC is being ""patient"" on interest rates

* low inflation and low oil prices suggest easing rates or holding steady

* continued job gains could suggest tightening

* no immediate plans to raise or lower interest rates

* outlook is NEUTRAL



GBP (0.50% interest rate)

* in January, rates were held unchanged

* lots of QE over last few years (approx. 375B GBP)

* BOE forecasting inflation from 1% in 2015, to 1.4% 4Q 2015, to 1.8% 4Q 2016

* BOE could cut interest rates if inflation is weaker than expected

* if inflation stays on track, next move in interest rates would be up, estimated by mid-2016

* outlook is NEUTRAL



JPY (0.10% interest rate)

* BOJ cut inflation forecast from 1.7% to 1.0%

* QE continues, more stimulus expected in October 2015

* BOJ driving toward target of 2% inflation

* more stimulus will further increase money supply and weaken currency

* outlook is NEUTRAL or DOWN



CAD (0.75% interest rate)

* interest rate cut in January from 1.0%

* BOC expecting low growth and low inflation

* easing monetary policy, weakening currency

* outlook is DOWN



CHF (-0.75% interest rate)

* SNB scrapped three-year peg in January of 1.20CHF/EUR

* resulted in huge gains of CHF

* SNB felt CHF was overvalued, but EUR has depreciated against USD, and CHF has depreciated against USD, which means SNB is now comfortable with letting CHF gain further

* outlook is NEUTRAL or UP



AUD (2.25% interest rate)

* RBA recently cut rates from 2.5%

* RBA feels AUD may be overvalued and is easing monetary policy to weaken AUD

* RBA target may be $0.75 - $0.70 USD

* outlook is DOWN



NZD (3.5% interest rate)

* RBNZ expects a long pause on interest rates

* expecting low oil prices, low inflation

* RBNZ feels NZD may be overvalued, and may cut 3.5% rate, but no immediate plans for this

* if the next interest rate move is up, estimated time frame is mid-2016

* outlook is NEUTRAL or DOWN",11,0.93

* don't doubt or fuck w/ London. they will dictate the direction of the day. 
* trade only yen pairs during Tokyo session. don't touch USD pairs.
* if price does not react strongly immediately in an s/d zone, it is imbalanced. if it is retouched constantly, then it is going to be drained.
* if between s/d levels, note the range and speed between the two. expect a shifting price until an imbalance occurs.

1120,2015-02-24,Interview with The Father of Lunar Cycle Trading,"I subscribe to the ""[Top Traders Unplugged](http://toptradersunplugged.com/)"" podcast which interviews hedge fund managers. This week the interview was with Mahindra Sharma - a Financial Astrologer (yup, those two words together in the same sentence). 

I'm not quick to pre-judge other's methods without first trying them out (Elliot waves and harmonic patterns seem kooky to me, but others make good profits off of them), but this seems to really push the boundaries of logic out into the twilight zone. 

A quote: 
> Tech stocks follow the movements of Mars. 

Mr. Sharma claims to have predicted the fall of the USSR, among other things. Niels Kaastrup-Larsen (fund manager and podcaster) claims this is his ""MOST IMPORTANT conversation to date"" and tells us that Mr. Sherma's $150 book on 2015 predictions might be the ""MOST important book you can ever buy"" (all the caps are his - there were bold underlined too!). He also says that he used the 2014 book and it was pretty accurate. 

I thought all this lunar cycle trading was fringe stuff until I heard a seemingly level-headed fund manager talking about them. Having said that, the easiest way to test this is to wait for his (very specific) predictions to come true. Some of the ones I remember are:

* Facebook will drop close to $1 per share in early 2017 (if the company doesn't make drastic changes)
* $DJIA will hit 32,000
* Rates will start rising drastically (not gradually) from June of 2015 (not only for the USD but for the EUR,JPY,etc if I heard correctly)

The full interview is here: http://toptradersunplugged.com/how-astrology-cycles-can-predict-financial-markets-mahendra-sharma-financial-astrology/

Oh, and he regrets not seeing the SNB coming. 

Oh, and he achieved 13,228% growth in 5 months in 2005 (an achievement that was submitted the the Guiness Book - allegedly).

I don't really set a stop/loss because the market fluctuates soo much that i don't want it to trigger a loss and sell right before it goes up. I've had several very small wins that get me going but these big losses are really ticking me off. I need to switch focus and learn how I can catch these drops, I think. I'm not sure how long I can hold on to this pair. I've heard some have held a pair for as long as 5 days.

I had a strategy that was working pretty good with 20 and 30k lots. Right when I think I have it figured out, I strike with a 50k lot and then the currency drops dramatically.  /endRant

To extend my vision, I start studying CFDs, such as Stock Index, Oil, Commodity, etc.  
Unlike Forex, I don't understand how margin and pip value is calculated for Stock Index and other CFDs.  
  
I tested with Oanda CFD, seems the margin for 1 unit UK 100 is about $10000, and 1 unit Brent Crude Oil is about $50.  
Seems the margin for BCO is just the price of the oil, but how about the Stock Index, what's the price?  
  
Thanks

EDIT: the margin I talked above is the total money required, not leveraged. And the leverage provided by Oanda is 50. So the leveraged margin for 1 unit BCO is only $1.

EDIT2: Though on Oanda forum nobody answered my question about what the multipliers are, eventually I realized for fxTrade the multipliers are just 1, but different conttacts are quoted in different currency.  
FTSE is quoted in GBP, so 1 contract value is 7000 GBP, which is about 10000 USD, which is exactly how I observed. And the pip value is always 1 quote currentcy. For FTSE, the pip value is 1 GBP, which is about 1.5 USD.

We anticipate the upside risk on the USD against AUD if the FOMC statement is in line with hawkish and if the US Q1 GDP figure comes in better than expected at 1.0%, then poor US economic news is getting priced in by the market. The weakness in the US dollar and strength in the Australian dollar has been pretty clear. AUD is up over 2% overnight and close to around +7% since mid April.

Keeping an eye on week ahead:

FOMC statement
1st May: US manufacturing PMI
5th May: RBA keeps rates on hold
8th May: US non-farm payroll data misses again 

Formulation of Derivative Strategy:

For US importers who have their payable exposures in AUD, we advocate a buy call on ATM (At The Money) AUDUSD put options.
Buy an ATM 0.80149 Put option with a May 12 expiry.
Costing maximum funds at risk is US$ 897.65 per lot with a breakeven of 0.7938.
Bear in mind that we are well above the levels that we've been over the RBA's February, March and April meetings. I.e. a higher AUD gives them more of a case to cut rates
Entry: ATM (At-The-Money), 0.80149Maximum loss to the extent of premium paid as we are long the put option
Target: Triggered by expected RBA cut on May 5

1187,2015-05-02,Government Bond Yields and their affect on the currency,"Hey r/Forex I’m back with another confusion searching for your wisdom. I’m trying to understand govt. bond yields, but I see a contradiction *maybe* according to BabyPips…
Quote 1:
Demand for bonds usually increases when investors are concerned about the safety of their stock investments. This flight to safety drives bond prices higher and, by virtue of their inverse relationship, pushes bond yields down.

From what I understand – Flight to safety -> Demand for USD -> USD Bull ALSO Bond prices higher = Bond yields lower
Quote 2:
For example, in the U.S., you would focus on the 10-year Treasury note. A rising yield is dollar bullish. A falling yield is dollar bearish.

While here it says that a rising yield is dollar bullish (also implying a falling bond price)..

Maybe someone can shed a bit more light on how bond yields affect a currency for me please?

1189,2015-05-05,Aussie bulls show remarkable resilience post rate cut,"Today Reserve bank of Australia (RBA) delivered 25 basis points rate cut bringing RBA's benchmark lending rate to 2%. Aussie lost ground initially however bulls showed remarkable resilience and pushed the pair to new intraday high.

Key highlights from RBA policy -

* RBA recognizes improvement in household demand and overall employment. However remain concern over business capital expenditure in both mining and non-mining sector. RBA expects lower capital expenditure along with subdued public spending would keep economic activity somewhat subdued for the next one or two years.
* While low interest rates would continue to be supportive of borrowing and spending according to RBA, it might also be contributing to higher property prices. Real estate prices are rising sharply in Sydney, for which RBA is working with regulators to contain the risk.
* RBA doesn't see any threat of high inflation arising from lower exchange rate, on the contrary according to RBA, Aussie might fall further against pairs other than dollar.
Aussie traded dropped to 0.7784 from 0.7852 after the announcement, however recover soon and traded around 0.792, three day high within moments.

As of now, it seems that bulls seems pretty strong, however it is too early to say that bears have given up completely as they defended 0.80 key resistance area well. Wait and watch is advised with less positions as price might consolidate here. This week's NFP report might lead to a breakout.

Let's say I have a million dollars in my account. I only ever open up one position with a single standard lot. My SL is, at most, 100 pips. So worst case scenario (barring slippage or illiquid markets), I'm risking $1000 on the trade (let's say USD is the quote currency to make it simple). If I don't use leverage, put up $100k(ish), and the trade moves against me, I lose $1000. Alternatively, I use 50:1 leverage, and only have put up $2000ish of my own money to open the same position. It also moves 100 pips against me and I lost $1000.  No difference. Am I missing something?

The point of this post isn't to bash one or the other, it's to show how they work together and why both mehtods can work.

**Fundamental Analysis**

If you trade based on fundamentals, you try to analyzing WHAT drives traders to take certain buy/sell actions. 

In short, you're trying to analyze economic stats, (geo)politics and psychology. Some fundamental traders exclude general market psychology though.

**Technical analysis**

You base trades on price action...so solely on what happens on charts. There are tons of ways to analyze charts using everything from pure candlesticks to indicators and stuff like supply/demand trading. 

In this case, you care more about what traders really do than why they're doing it. If the latest US retail figures push up the dollar, that's great...but you are long because price action tells you to go long, not because of some economic stats. 

**So what's ""better""?**

Simple answer? It comes down to personal perference. Both are just different ways of coming to conclusions about future price moves. Fundamentals drive price, technicals are the actual moves.

To use a methaphor: 

Imagine a random dude in the Alaskan wilderness during winter...snow everywhere. You are trying to figure out where he's going. 

Now you can talk to his mate Pete, who will tell you he last saw his mate next to the giant tree 50km from Anchorage. You also ask Jack who tells you he saw him near the lake not too far from the giant tree a few minutes ago.

You examine that info and come to the conclusion that the dude's clearly walking north...so that's where you'll look for him. 

That's how a fundamental trader approaches trading. He tries to guess how certain information will influence price. 

Now a technical trader would try to find the wilderness dude differently. He wouldn't care about Jack's opinion at all. He would find the dude's footprints and simply follow those prints. If those footprints lead north, cool...you'll head north. If it suddenly changes west for no apparent reason, you don't care about the reason and simply head west. 

*Both ways can lead to the same result...you finding wilderness dude!*

**What do I prefer and why**

I'm basing trades 100% on TA despite having economics-related degrees and working in commercial real estate investments. 

The way I look at it, fundamental analysis requires you to have equal access to information as those moving markets...aka the big boys. I know economic theory suggests markets should be efficient (which includes the availability of information), but in reality, that's simply not the case.

Some are able to pay to get more info. Others have connections YOU or I don't have. Some info is leaked to only a small group of people. In short, I don't doubt for a second that no matter how hard I analyze something fundamentally, someone will have better info and if he's a market mover and I'm on the wrong side of things due to a lack of info...I will lose. I hate losing ;)

For FA, not only do you have to analyze fundamentals properly, that analysis also has to match those from market movers. It also involves a lot of guessing of news sometimes. So not only do you have to ""guess"" fundamentals, you also have to guess how traders will react to it and when.

*That's a lot of guessing!*

It may sound kinda stupid, but the way I look at it, it's quite simple:

If price goes up, I buy. If it goes down, I sell. Obviously all in the context of different timeframes. I don't question WHY it moves up or down because even if I knew, it wouldn't really change how price moves anyway.

As a fundamental trader, it's really hard to have tight stop losses because it's difficult to time things. 

For all I care, I could be trading unicorns and price goes up or down depending on how many daily pushups Chuck Norris does. All I know is that if it goes down and I'm short, I make money...and if it goes up while I'm long, I make money too. That's all I really care about.

**But again, I'm not bashing FA at all...you can get the same results, I just think it's much muuuuuch harder especially in terms of timing trades.**

Nothing's stopping you from combining TA with FA by the way, personally I just don't see the point unless you're interested about fundamentals. ",17,0.87

1223,2015-06-01,Another reason why perhaps people are losing confidence with this sub...,"I have been following this forum for over a year and recently I have noticed a new level of frustration here. The general consensus seems to be that the good traders left and now the rest aren't as helpful, as informative, etc. 

But what if the frustration has something to do with the season? During the summer the markets tend to be more erratic since the big money has gone off on vacation. A few months ago the EUR/USD was strongly trending and you didn't have to be a market wizard in order to profit. Now with the new nature of the markets moods have sank to new lows.

So taking into consideration the seasonality of the markets many here are at a low point, losing hope in their trading, nowhere near the attitudes of the confident traders we were in the strongly trending markets of 2014. And perhaps that's what we should take away from this experience -- that markets are always changing and we also must adapt.

OANDA reserves the right to debit your Account for the difference between the price shown in fxTrade at the time of your Trades and an amount equal to 1.0-pip above OANDA’s actual volume-weighted cost of clearing those Trades.


Clause 15.  Risk Acknowledgement. You acknowledge that trading in Foreign Currency Contracts and CFDs carries a high degree of risk and that you have familiarised yourself with the risks described in OANDA’s Risk Disclosure Statement. These risks include, without limitation, the following: (i) it is possible to incur a loss if, after your acquisition of an investment, exchange rates change to your detriment, even if the price of the underlying currency to which the Trade relates remains unchanged; and (ii) you may sustain a total loss of the Margin Requirement in respect of your Account that you deposit with or pay to us to establish or maintain a position and, if the market moves against you, you may be required to pay substantial additional funds at short notice but if you fail to do so within the required time, your investment position may be liquidated at a loss to you and you will be liable for any remaining deficit in your Account.

Its a bit silly given that they used their ""CHF debacle forgiveness"" as an ad campaign to now turn around and basically be exactly like everyone else.

The drop in oil prices has been savage for us and doesn't show a lot of signs of rebounding in a significant way.  Our oil is expensive to produce (oil sands, Canadian wages, etc.)  We're just starting to realize the full impact of that.  Even if we do get a rebound, the fact that we had to sell oil for so cheap for so many months will have a lasting impact and there will be reluctance to make new investments util oil prices stay high again for a while.

Our central bank slashed our interest rate recently and it is highly suspected they will do it again on Wednesday.  Jobs numbers on Friday did not look good and many people are suggesting that we have now technically entered a recession.  

Our consumers are indebted to the tilt with excessive amounts of mortgage debt.  Crack shacks in Vancouver sell for over $1 million.   Even in tiny towns, houses go for ridiculous prices.  Because these excessive prices have existed for a few years, it may actually be more dangerous than a bubble that grows very quickly before bursting.  There are a huge number of people who took on mortgages at these inflated prices.   Note that Canadians only lock in an interest rate for the first five years of their mortgage and then need to renew.

We buy a lot of our stuff (food especially,) from the US.  We can try to push down the CAD relative to USD to help our export sector but it leads to inflation.

At the federal level, we're 99 days from an election.  We can expect that not much will get done in the next six months.   The government has said that there will be no stimulus.

As you dive deeper into the plans in each province, it's unclear how we will become competitive.  Ontario should be doing well with manufacturing as a result of the low CAD but companies keep moving out.  Our trade deficit is nearing record highs.   BC is placing all its chips on LNG and it seems like too little too late and it's very possible that none of the projects will move forward.  We're facing some local weather issues as well with a drought in the west.

The economic opportunities that we do have often look lackluster once you get into the details.  For example, Microsoft is expanding in Vancouver but then it was discovered that the primary motivation is to bring in temporary foreign workers (much fewer jobs for locals) and they got a special exemption to do that.

I'm trying my best to be optimistic but I can't see how CAD will possibly climb above $0.80 in the coming years unless something horrible happens to the US economy.  Some of the doomsday calls for a $0.60 CAD don't seem as unreasonable anymore.   As a guy who can work on either side of the border, I am seriously thinking about working in the US to be paid in USD.

What are professional forex traders doing with CAD?

1272,2015-07-15,Making money trading forex if you have no money?,"I live in a poor country where salaries are very low.. So there's no way that I can have a regular job that lets me save up $50k for trading.. not even $25k. 

I know that some websites look for good traders that they will let their clients(investors) choose which trader they want to invest in and then the trader gets 15% of the profits and the website gets 5%. 

I wonder a bit about how difficult or long time it takes to get investors to invest money on you? I know it's very tough to answer without going into lots of details about what ROI you have, drawdown etc but if you have for example traded for half a year and have a ROI of 15% total so far? 

I'm afraid the serious investors won't consider any trader that don't have at least 2-3 years history. 

I mean, let's say I get a few investors and I'm now trading a total of $10k .. let's say I make for them 20% annual roi that's $2k annual profit equaling $166 per month and I get 15% of that profit so my monthly income would be just $25 per $10k that is invested in me? So even if I'm trading for $100k total I would just be getting $125 per month which is very little, actually unsurvivable even in my poor country. I would need to be trading for a minimum of half a million usd for these investors before I can support myself. 

I think maybe I should forget about forex? Because I've been successful at it so far, studied it for 3 months but I've also studied it for about half a year prior to those 3 months and I've gotten good results so far but I don't have any real money to trade with... just enough for minimum deposit on a micro account. Just feels like a shame to give it up after so much hard work. 

I used to play poker before I began with forex and I was actually able to make $500-$1000 per month and that is quite nice for my country but not great either.. most people make around $400-$500. 
And the thing about poker is that you don't need much money to make $500 per month. You can earn that from just playing $20 husng's or $25nl (blinds = $0.1/$0.25).. you can even get $500 per month just from $10nl If you put in a lot of hours every single day. 

I regret a bit stopping to play poker now and thinking of going back to playing poker but it's been a long time since I played poker now so I would have to spend probably 1-2 months getting into the swing of things.",5,0.7

1315,2015-09-06,Short on AUD/JPY,"So these are just my opinions on some short term fundamentals, if anyone has a different view, or more insightful information, comment and let me know : ).

I've been short on AUDUSD over the past couple of weeks as it has been a pretty sure bet, and it has profited well. However I have looked over charts, and potential profits if I had of shorted the AUDJPY, and there has been almost twice the movement down. I see this trend continuing and will be looking for jump into short AUDJPY after any short term rallies.

With the continuing strength of the JPY to the USD, and the bearish views on the AUD in general. AUDJPY is looking a pretty good risk-reward scenario for going short.
  
**AUD**  
  
Keep an eye on commodity prices continuing to head south, and any negative news from china, as that will put downward pressure on the AUD. Australia is putting out some pretty negative data in terms of its own growth, if that continues the RBA is likely to make another interest rate cut. Australia seems to be following closely in Canada's footsteps economy wise, and it won't surprise me to see Australia's first recession in 2016 after almost 3 decades of solid growth. Big reasons for this are our resource exports, and china making up more than 30% of all exports.
  
The AUD is in a bit of a free fall at the moment and could snap back at any moment. But in my opinion any rallies will be short lived and should be viewed as buying opportunities.  

**JPY**
  
For JPY strength, keep an eye on US and Japanese equities, as they seem to be pretty correlated at the moment, and any news from the BOJ

**USD**

After Fridays data, the fed probably isn't going to raise rates this month, so the market is probably going to price that in over the next couple of weeks, and the USD will move sideways or down. If they do raise hikes, I see some pretty serious stock market volatility, USD strength against emerging market currencies, and traders jumping to the JPY to wait out the mark turmoil. So if the fed hikes I see USD and JPY going up.

1328,2015-09-24,Newbie here and I need help,"Hi, so I opened an account with TD Ameritrade to trade stocks with last year and ended up getting side tracked with other things (college). I decided this month to look back into trading and really try to educate myself and truly understand whats going on rather than just looking at a chart and guessing, and also try other things besides stocks. So for the past two weeks I've been attempting to trade forex with the paper money account TD provides. 

So, today I was doing pretty okay. I went long on EUR/GBP and over the course of 2 hours made $217 with my fake money. I was pretty happy. Then I proceed to lose $500 when I went long on EUR/USD and five minutes later it hit its daily high and plummeted after that. After that knife in the my gut, I decided to take a break and go do some things, come back in a more stable state of mind. For the last hour I've been trying to pull some money out of the market here and there. I made a few bucks back, but then I took a loss that really pissed me off. I'm using TD's ThinkOrSwim platform to trade with and I must be missing something or don't understand something. I analyzed my charts for about 5 minutes and drew my trend lines and marked important price points. I was looking for the EUR/USD to go long after it took a quick dive and made a double bottom. I set a BUY LMT order at 1.1180 and set my stop loss for 10 pips less and 50% take profits for 20 pips and the rest take profit at 50 pips above my entry. I left it to do its thing and I come back around 20 minutes later to see that the price is now 5 pips past my BUY LMT order and for some reason I haven't entered yet even though I set the order up. I don't seem to have this problem when I set up an order to short though. 

I do have an issue with shorting and I guess I just don't understand what I'm doing. I analyzed my charts and was going to short EUR/GBP. I entered at 0.7337 and watched it drop to almost 0.7330. I was expecting a nice little profit when I looked at the P/L Open to see that I was negative almost $70. I thought if you short it you make money when the pair goes down in price? I've also had the opposite happen when going long on quick trades (15 min or less) where the price is now well above my entry but I'm in the negative on my P/L open.

I'm just really confused now and need some help, both with what types of orders to use and when to use them, and also with ThinkOrSwim itself. I thought if I wanted to go Long I should use a BUY LMT order as opposed to MKT order to know I'm not paying more than what I want to but when I set those BUY LMT orders up they aren't being executed.

1333,2015-10-09,"Bad situation on account, what would you do.","So I've got myself into a bad situation by trying a strategy on live without back testing.


Normally I have a very stable, tried and tested strategy. It gives 0-30% returns monthly and over 4-5 months has never produced a negative month. 


Last month however I got to +4% by the end of the month (a relatively poor result compared to the strategies previous months). Then the NFP happened, and like a massive noob I didn't close my USD positions. The move blew through a few of my trades taking me to -6%~. I saw the equity going down and thought it was going to reverse, I shut it down at -6% when I realized it was an NFP result.


So I figured in order to increase the gains the next month I'd try two strategies simultainously. The first would be the tried and tested strategy. The second would be a much longer term strategy on basic trend following. I hadn't tested this out yet but it seemed pretty safe.


The strategy was like this: Use a multi time frame EMA with frames selected to identify a long term trend.  (see: http://imgur.com/6OCTGqR) The pink line is the shortest time frame EMA, orange second shortest, red longest. The idea is to get a visual of the LONG term trend (weekly/monthly) without having to check two charts. I picked EMAs so that the 'gap' between the pink line and orange lines would highlight a dynamic suppport range of the trend. I bought in on touches of the pink, and stoplosses just below the orange line.


I entered maybe 10 positions on these grounds. A little excessive, but they all matched the criteria. Over the last week ALL of them have gone into the negative, with two of them outright closing. They aren't individually massively over leveraged. (no more than 3-4% per trade) however ALL of them are going wrong. 
(Gallery of painful positions: http://imgur.com/a/jdoB3)

At the moment im at 34% draw down. Which is way more than I've ever had. Normally I'd close all my positions and go back to using the old strategy. But as you can see from the pictures some of these positions are still 'valid'.


Anyone tried a strategy like this before? What kind of draw down do we expect?  The big problem I see is that I didn't backtest the strategy. I figured it was so long term that the chance of it blowing out completely and quickly would be pretty slim, but it's looking grim. Am I just the unluckiest person ever that predicted the end of 10 trends on 10 seperate pairs?

EDIT:
What I'm going to do is stop opening new positions on the long term strategy, continue opening positions on the tried and tested strategy. 

I'm going to let the long term position strategies that I'm already in play out.

I'm going to open a demo account where I try the long term strategy play on only one of each unrelated pair.

Set a sell limit at 1.141 as well as 1.146 with a stop somewhere near the top of my red rectangle, if it breaks through there I'm thinking we'll be visiting 1.17 again.

Eurozone is fundamentally weak and long term should tank to near parity once again especially whenever Yellen and her cronies man up and hit the switch on the us interest rates.

Have I essentially bought the same ""dollar amount"" in both cases? Is one case riskier than the other? Does each pip have a different value in each of these cases? Or is this situation (Same SL & TP) exactly the same?

For some reason I haven't been able to get a concrete answer to this question.

He says the echange rate is 1(USD) x 1.37 = 1.37(CAD) and 1(USD) ÷ 1.37 = 0.72(CAD) therefore the exchange rate is 37%.

Traders who were long USD are long already with more traders moving to the sideline as the big day nears. 

Feds are committed for the rate hike however, I think it will be accompanied by dovish statement about the economy and they will emphasize not to expect any more rate hikes for the most of 2016. Most traders will be focused on what Ms. Yellen has to say and if she will be hawkish or dovish. If she goes on a tangent and starts talking about another rate hike in the first quarter, for example, then we could see dollar rally post FOMC.

> I think gbpusd will retrace to ~1.51 before continuing lower  

There is a great conference where Hugh Hendry, the founder and manager of Eclectica Asset Management discusses why this approach is problematic. His point is this: information which leads you to believe you can glimpse the future is dangerous. As operators or speculators it is best to operate in the here and now. Forecasting is great if you want to stimulate or nurse your ego and I am not interested in doing either.  

Some things that I could have done differently for this trade: I was looking at GBP weakness. I saw that GBPJPY had reached a major point of interest and I neglected to take a trade there as my account was already levered into GBPUSD. I cannot do anything about this because it is in the past but I have transferred some more cash into the account in case I want to get more aggressive with GBPUSD or with a different position in the future.  

When will I close this position? When it hits a point of interest and reverses. I'm watching the DX to figure that out it is pretty fucking clear.  

I spent my holidays with family and took a vacation to visit friends, one of whom is an bond trader for a large banking institution, brilliant individual. It is interesting because when we were in school I was in the study room trading FX at 5am and he was studying for classes. The other friend does accounting work for a big 4 company but is switching firms.  

It really hit me while I was visiting. Think of how fucking stupid the average person is and realize there are a ton of people that are dumber than that. The market is a game. Nothing ever really changes. There are stupid people with high paying jobs and that have a ton of power. You are up against the ""pros"" all the time in the market but you only have to be right and profit a small percentage of the time if you know when to be aggressive. Anyways good luck and everyone who reads this better have had a great holiday and if not fix it, it's on you to be happy. ",7,0.71

My last series of questions are at the bottom.

I live in the EST time zone and i'm starting to reach a point where the US session does not provide enough sustained volatility to trade throughout the entire day. You could best describe my market behavior as a scalper on the 5min time frame. my favorite pairing to trade are the Euro/USD and USD/CAD (1hr time frame).  I normally trade between 7:00am - 11:00pm.  I enter the majority of my positions during 7:00 am - 11:00am.  I look to exit ALL of my positions by 2:00pm. On 2:00pm news events i trade till 5:00pm. (there are exceptions to these time frames but this is a standard day for me)

I rest between 2:00pm to 6:30pm.

I start retrading the Asian session (euro/usd) at 7:00pm and end at 11:00pm. I probably enter and close 2 trades on average. 3 at most.  On some occasions none. funny thing is i was considering quitting the Asian session and China happened... it kind of revitalized my willpower to make this work...

I do most of my journal writing and trade logging during this time period.  Asian session is boring as hell. I don't normally trade the JPY or AUD pairings so i'm guessing this contributes to it.  There are some days i ignore the Asian Session altogether and do my logging/journal-ing after 2:00pm. I like having this option once in awhile when i want to take a break.



What can i do differently to make Asian session more productive? Am i just a london session trader? Do i need to start branching out to different pairs?


I'm starting to think it might be more efficient and productive for me to trade between 3:00 am to 1:00pm EST. I'll skip Asian session but my circadian rhythm will be wack. I do not want to start going to bed at 8:00pm...",3,0.8

My name is definitely not a Gordon, but I'd like to become a Wolf of Wall Street someday. Unfortunately I'm from central Europe, so trading FX is the only way to feel the market. Any way, I'd like to share with my ideas for two pairs: EUR/GBP and AUD/USD. I think both of them are pretty clear, but if you'd like to hear an explanation feel free to ask. 

AUD/USD: http://comparic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/127.png

EUR/GBP: http://comparic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/310.png

EUR/GBP is right above 0.77. If I see a confirmation form buy side I will open a market order right away. SL under last local minimum. 

Edit2: EUR/GBP trade failed. I was buying at 0,7699 with SL under last low (0,7666). As I said previously I opened a market order (which wasn't a bad idea) but also have looked more broadly and set a limit buy order around 0,7650. SL activated, few pips untill my second order would be opened. Total loss 33 pips - ouch. 

AUD/USD didn't fulfilled my standing order, I cancelled it few minutes ago (6 am GMT)

I covered my GBP/USD at 1.4160 after last Tuesday's steep selloff and stop, the price was unable to continue below 1.4150.  

I covered for 200%. That is right, I made 200% on my entire account. Awesome. It is over. That trade is in the past, I covered. I made one mistake: I did not add more below 1.45, I won't make that mistake again.  

How I feel: slightly euphoric but when I take a few deep breaths and look out my window at the wonderful view I have of the creek and nature I calm down.  

What I am most proud of: I covered a great trade and I did not enter a new one in the last week in an attempt to make more money, chase more gains, etc. I am waiting patiently to enter a new position and you will hear about it when it happens, win or lose because neither is a bad outcome, only an outcome. Good luck and fuck tipsters, fuck know it alls, fuck everyone who says fibonacci's, RSI's, ATR, etc. is a profitable way to trade. And you are in big fucking trouble if you continue to buy lows or sell highs, that is the wrong way to trade and we are programmed to trade that way as well as seek information that gives us a feeling of certainty. *Nothing is certain*.  

EDIT:  

My opinions are always going to be perceived as arrogant. I do not care. Many people are going to try and debate me; as much as I enjoy discussion I will not be endearing. I trade the way I trade and I have my own thoughts as does everyone. I am not forcing mine upon you so show me the same respect.

I did not enter a new one in the last week in an attempt to make more money *hastily and unnecessarily*  

I do not think I will succeed, I know I will and I'm sure that scares people. When I say that, it is not synonymous with I will not fail because that is not true. I roll with failure and embrace it because from it I grow.

1480,2016-01-26,Hedging foreign exchange risk on an upcoming investment,"Hi all, I don't have any idea if this is the right place to look for help but figured I'd give it a shot. 

I work for a small investment company (in the USA) that is looking to fund a $2 million Canadian commercial real estate investment steadily in unpredictable increments over the next 12 months or so (e.g. $400k may be called on March 12, then $70k in April, $1.1 mil in August, etc.).  My boss made a similar investment previously and felt she got burned because the Canadian dollar quickly rose in value just prior to the big capital calls.

My boss doesn't have the stomach to handle that volatility again and has now tasked me with ""hedging"" against this risk.  She's really only worried about the risk of the Canadian dollar becoming more expensive on the front end, even though in practical terms I imagine the foreign exchange risk persists throughout the term of the investment until the final exit back into USD.  

I'm fresh out of school with a finance degree that I feel is currently failing me, as I'm really at a loss as to 1) determining which kind of instrument to utilize and 2) once that's decided, how to go about executing that strategy without getting ripped off.  I have no practical background in buying any kind of derivative instrument, so any kind of help would be hugely appreciated.  What should I do?

Edit- If in the wrong place, can someone please direct me in the right direction?  Thanks!

Basically this is all new and crazy too me. I work for a company in Dubai and a large amount of my colleagues are investing in a Forex company called UTMarkets. Forever I thought it was a stupid ponzi scheme-scam, but since a few years passed and my colleagues have made a ton of money I decided to take the plunge.

- Basically this company invests the money for you. You have to make an account of minimum $10,000 USD then they start making the trades.
- Everyone will have the same trades (when trades are made) but the amounts of profit or lose will be different based on how large your account is.
- The company basically guarantees you 100% of your money back after 6 months.
- You can make withdrawals once a month and you usually get the money in 3 working days (I haven't withdrawn yet but colleagues have and say it's good)

I would like to post a few pictures of the trades they made, but I don't know if it will reveal any information that would be personal to the company? Would anyone like to check some of this stuff out?

This trade is based off things learned here.

I used the 20 day SMA and 8 day EMA to see where the big sellers would come in (since overall trend is down).

If you follow both of the moving averages you will notice how when it lines up with the support zone shown we get reversals (bounces) and breakouts.

1492,2016-02-03,Help with position sizing (Oanda),"Hi,

Relatively new UK spread betting/trader here, wondering if I can get a little help with position sizing. I recently opened an Oanda account due to some recommendations on here and  the fact that they have no minimum deposit and very small position sizing.

I'm hoping to cement my strategy on a very small level and then scale it up once I gain confidence and account size. Currently piggy backing buy signals from Autochartist on their Forex recommendations with over 75% probability in order to help my spot potential trades. However I'm having difficulty determining my position size...


e.g. Account size is £100, i got to open a position on EUR/USD and I'm told there are c 6,100 positions available for my account size. I want to risk 2% of my capital per trade. Lets hypothetically say for this trade my stop loss distance is 100 pips and take profit is 200, as I'd like to maintain  a 2:1 ratio of win size vs loss size.

I know there must be a formula that I can use to determine how many positions (of the 6,100 possible) I want to reserve for this trade so that a 100 pip move to stop loss represents 2% of my capital lost but I just cant seem to work it out!

many thanks in advance",9,0.91

Obviously massive move here. We just made new quarterly highs, SPX is crashing again, we're seeing the first 1h consolidation of this run, and most importantly the Euro has FIIINALLY fought its way out of that god-forsaken range. I think we're set to gain at least another 80 pips into the mid-high 11s before a massive sell-off. 1.11 doesn't show a lot of resistance - the previous high was, IMO, the more significant resistance (ergo this consolidation we just saw). I bet we punch through 1.11 easy-peasy. 

Got a 5 mini stop buy at 1.1084 pending. Stoploss is at 1.1074 - I'm expecting this break to be explosive and fast, with little pullback. Here's hoping it is...

[AIEEEEEEE!](http://i.imgur.com/Z8Awvxw.png)

That's my first 3 digit trade in Forex!  I've never made more than $100 on a Forex trade holy shit!  That was a rush I haven't felt since I was daytrading stocks.  

I could have traded that a hell of a lot better but I'm not gonna complain lol.  I got crazy lucky, to be honest - as you can see I sold 30k manually at 10904, and I forgot to change my lot size when I sold the second portion of my position and accidentally shorted one mini - which I then covered for a profit soon as I realized what I'd done.  Worked out!

FUCK YEAH.

Oh, also - it got *stuffed* at .112 so I figured I'd cut it off.  I still think we're gonna see higher 11s but I couldn't resist dem 3 digits while I had'em

Edit 2: this 1m consolidation on 11 looks very promising... But for the scalpers, keep in mind that the 2.5 hr consolidation only produced a 50 pip immediate move. This one might be good for 1125 to 115 but *be careful, it might fake and start forming a top*.  I recommend a tight stop below your entry, a true break right here wouldnt grind too much. I'd stay away tho, its late in the run. ",7,0.82
1495,2016-02-03,Crushing losses for USD today.,"I had three trade setups and all three got stopped out, more on that later.  Greenback lost up to 2% against the major currencies. It all started when fed president and FOMC-voter Dudley said that market turmoil may alter the Fed's growth outlook and that financial conditions are tighter now than in December. His comment sent the dollar weaker initially while completely overshadowed ADP report. Then ISM non-manufacturing PMI report came out lower than expected. This was the catalyst needed which resulted in massive selling of USD. Usually, ISM non-manufacturing or ADP does not cause this kind of a reaction. We expect major moves when NFP or a central banks make decisions. So, today's move can only be attributed to Dudley's comments.  I had following trades:

    short NZDUSD @ 0.6450, s/l 0.6650
    short EURUSD @ 1.0920, s/l  1.1120
    long USDJPY @ 120.65, s/l  118.65

1506,2016-02-08,Here's what I'm looking for to stay bullish on EUR/USD,"Possibly the most ambitiously predictive and intricately annotated chart I've ever posted on here.  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SRMNvFi5/

I think the behavior in the next 2 hours is gonna tell us if we're in an uptrend or if this is an h+s reversal. If we push back up and keep testing 65 resistance = trend is bout to continue up. But a higher low in the 40s, or a straight break below 1120 is gonna mean it's a HS imo, with the next significant event being whether or not 11 holds up.  I think if we find a bottom soon up above 113 it'll be a nice bullish indicator - and watch out for the fucking lower low the euro loves to throw at us before breakouts.  Mmrargh 

I'll be buying 2 minis at the .115 soft resistance break, with a risk in the 40s where my expected lower low is gonna be.  I'll get in to the other 3 at 66 when we break that resistance and have a nice avg entry of 116.  I'll take profits on EVERYTHING in the nineties, I don't want to sit through an multi-hour consolidation in that area, I'd rather just re-evaluate then and buy whatever breakout may occur.  

The max risk I'm gonna be taking on this trade is the pre-emptive 2 mini buy at the 50s, probably $24 bucks after spread with a 10 pip stop in the low 40s where that final dip will be.  Once I hit the breakout I'll be five pips north of breakeven and I'll probably stop out high 50s for a $10-$15 loss if need be.  

I'm gonna be ALL bull on the Euro until I get a good reason not to.  If this isn't a goddamned start to a goddamned bulltrend then I'll lose my freaking mind.  

Oh and like I said in HoyES's thread, I want a ""Massive, Polished Balls of Cristal"" flair if I'm right.  Yes, Cristal.

* earning growth is at the highest level in a year
* Manufacturing payrolls, avg working hours, labour force participation beat expectation. Americans are working and earning more.

I still think it'll be a nice play but I'm not going to be trading it.  I've also been through 22 mini lots today and am approaching overtrading status.  

Hey everyone.  I know I'm a big proponent of trading with the trend but the euro is getting fucking slaaaammed today and I think it's gonna have a sell off to the low 12s later today.  We're under a *weekly* resistance of 14 and the price action has just seemed incredibly bearish all day.  I've had two longs and two shorts so far, half of which have worked but the r/r has been really great so Ive made $34 and lost $10.  Looking for something bigger though and I think a short flush might run a good 10+ pips in a minute or two, which has me drooling.  

Charts: http://imgur.com/a/JeObz

Main support is around 1315 but all the way to 1305 is risky cause of those earlier wicks in this consolidation.  I'll try and catch it straight through 13, usually there's a brief moment or two of pause to get your ass in there.  If I take the trade I'm using a TIGHT STOP.  I'm thinking 1303.  You can always re-enter and I'll pay the probability penalties of such a tight stop cause fuuuuuck it's jumpy today.  Depending on how it looks in the low nineties I'll either shoot off a 1 pip trailstop or wait for it to drop to 1280.  

Remember - the target of this trade is to catch an explosive move through 13.  If the move isn't explosive, and it wicks multiple times near 1295, I will be exiting because that's not what I'm looking for and have planned for.  Trade the move, not the pips.  Pull out for a profit and re-enter if so desired, depending on how it looks.  All four of my trades today were 1 failed entry followed by a successful entry.  With such tight stops I have 2 or 3 chances to get the entry right and still turn a profit.  

Edit: just realized ""tight stop bc jumpy"" probably sounds strange. To clarify - when the market is jumpy, a ""typical"" stop will easily be taken out. You're left with 2 options - either increase your stop by a good number of pips to avoid getting stopped out, or use an incredibly tight stop with the full expectation of being stopped out once or twice before you catch the move.  

However, hopefully it quiets down this evening and lets me use a normal stop. These 10 pip 1m candles have been giving me gray hair all day.  

Edit: took 5 minis short a couple pips on that drop from 1315 to 1307, now we're consolidating between 131 and 1305. Looking to reenter with my OP trade if it drops more but couldn't resist shorting that 30m pin lol",2,0.75

Quick (possibly dumb) question...

Say, for example, you were conducting a fundamental analysis for USD/CAD from a global macro perspective. In doing so, would you conduct an analysis on both the US Dollar then the Canadian Dollar separately by looking at equity index price performance, earning forecasts, current accounts, TWI, economic activity of both countries, etc. ?

Then say, for example, after conducting this research, your fundamental outlook for both the USD and CAD are bearish... where would you expect USD/CAD to head next (ignoring technical analysis)? Would a bearish outlook for the USD have greater weight than a bearish outlook for the CAD (fundamentally)?

I was wondering about which Pairs you trade? And do you worry about the correlation between these pairs? 

I'm very fond of EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, USD/CHF and USD/CAD. I'm fond of these because when I started out they were all highly liquid (for me anyway) and the correlation was near very near 0% for most of them. And today I found out that this is not the case anymore. Today it even seemed that EUR/USD and USD/CHF had an almost perfect -100% correlation starting from the US open.

George Soros didn't get rich scalping price action, he bets big on big movies. To have the confidence to bet big, you must see a narrative forming that gives you a strong backdrop to support your trades. Once you have established the direction of the wind, you can more confidently gauge your risk and lean into the price action if it turns against you.

I've seen a few narratives come and go over the past year. Strong dollar, weak Euro was a great one that ended tragically with the ECB meeting in December. I recall the market being firmly on the side of parity, but Draghi didn't deliver and it unwound rather quickly bringing us from 1.05 to 1.13.

Weak Yen, with projections of 130 was another strong narrative from last year, that has unwound. It seems that each narrative reaches an extreme, consolidation and then a snap back to reality, so you have to be cautious on older narratives.

This year started out with Oil and risk off leading the market, but they have since reached a consolidation point. Gold seems to be still on the move.

My question to the community, is if they're interested in keeping threads around that allow us to chat about news within the context of a narrative.

The number #1 rule in this subreddit, is no empty news articles and I agree, but when news is categorized within a larger context, they begin to add up to something more informative.


For example, if we started a new thread named:

[Trading Narrative] Gold

Then we can post all news we read about gold within that thread and discus whether it is bearish or bullish. If more supply is coming online, bearish. If miners are closing down, bullish. If world economy is tanking, bullish. etc.

3. Certain currencies are only traded in relation to one other currency on the ForEx (USD/RUB, for example). Is that right, or is there a way that I could trade RUB directly for EUR, for example?

4. Suppose I end up with a good amount of JPY, but the Yen begins to have a net fall for a week relative to all major currencies. Is it possible to take the Yen I have and use it to trade stock on the TYO until the currency begins to increase in value?

Thanks in advance! As I said, I'm very new to ForEx and I'd want to be crystal clear on the basics before I start to work on a demo account - I'm not even considering using live money at this point.",8,1.0

Just wanted to pick your brains about this trade I'm thinking about (selling at 0.6850). http://i.imgur.com/seNz5J5.png

Technically, I would predict that the resistance here would hold, but in recent days, equities and the Australian dollar (correlated to NZD, I presume) seem to have been bullish enough to rip through that resistance zone around 0.6860/80. 

The RBNZ is expected to remain their rate the same, but so is the FOMC. Dairy prices continue to stay low, but non-dairy prices in NZ seem to be rising slightly now. Moreover, the fundamentals of the NZ economy seem to be getting stronger, but so is that of the United States. This all seems to give a very ""mixed-bag"" outlook for the NZD/USD pair.

What are your thoughts about this trade? Anyone's input on this trade would be greatly appreciated.",2,0.67

1560,2016-03-09,Shorting EUR/USD under 1050,"My post about sucking absolute donkey balls is at the top of the sub right now, so it goes without saying to take this with a grain of salt.  

Thaaaat being said, I think e/u is looking like it could form a lower high right about now.  My goal is to short after what looks like a lower high right below 105, I think that's going to send us back down into the low end of the 105-08 range. Risk will be above 106, second entry under 097, and take profit first in the low nines then high 08s.  

It's all described in the screenshots, and there's pretty colors too.  http://imgur.com/a/wxWeR

Oh and I think, if I'm wrong, we're going to see a lower high below 10 and it'll just drop from there.  I'll take that lower entry if it's looking like this final push is out of steam.  

EDIT 12:19 est - I put my money where my mouth is, dawg.  [1/2 lot short at 1.1019.](http://i.imgur.com/yLnCdKL.png)

Stop is currently at 1.103 dead.  Why, you ask?  It's something my mentor taught me, I didn't believe him at first but I eventually found it to be oh so true.  When you get a sharp rejection of a certain level (We hit 1.10297 or something) and you take the bounce, you want to put your stop right at the resistance, not one or two pips above.  The likelyhood of the price popping if it breaks that level is pretty damn good, and it's very hard to judge where it'll pop *to*.  Putting the stop somewhere above resistance is risky because it is very hard to judge just how far it'll pop.  It's better to get out there than it is to try to judge an appropriate amount of leeway to give, cause you're probably gonna get stopped out and end up paying more.

Of course, I'm probably about to get stopped out.  Ah well... only a $60 loss!

Edit right after: yup, there it goes.  fuck and now watch 1030 be the exact top haha.

Edit again: I'm such a cocksucker, fuck! I forgot to set my stop to trigger at MARK 1030, it was at ASK 1030. It wouldn't have hit! If that's the top I'm gonna lose my mind.  Wont start trading emotionally tho, not after yesterday...

1:48 pm est: [short again, slightly higher entry at 10205 stop at 1032.  I think the afternoon selloff has begun.  This one is up 4 pips so far, I'll probably  add more ~~if we get back into the 20s.~~](http://i.imgur.com/QlB5j4t.png) Scratch that, gonna wait for a trend to form then short the bounce off of 1.10.

2:18: [Sweeeet.  Stop is at B/E now](http://i.imgur.com/swyXYR1.png)

2:35 Stop is at 1014 now... 1.101 is looking pretty strong, if it pops we could see a re-test of the 30s and I'd rather lock in some profits and re-enter with a whole lot when the timing looks right.

9pm est: holy shit, that was a long day. Almost completely fucked up, AGAIN, but managed to save it.  Got jumpy and shorted the 1.10 break early, again, with a too-large position, again, and stopped out on it for a big loss, AGAIN, but this time I kept my cool and made it back (and then some). Trading is hard, lol. https://i.imgur.com/8vy1aKF.png. It's a small profit and I should have made much more, but it's a profit, I'm tired as hell, and I'm calling it a night.  I could probably keep running with this trend but I'm happy to be green for the day and I'm completely traded out.  GL y'all

1566,2016-03-14,Somehow I lost my mojo in forex and how I intend to get it back? My perspective!,"I've had great success trading forex, last 48 trades leading up to the end of 2015, I had 85% success rate. Only three of my trade had hit stop loss until then. January was a great month as well. However, from February onward my trades have been not-so-great. I'm still maintaining about 60% accuracy. Of 50 trades that I've put since the end of January 28 of them have been winners, 2 were canceled, and 20 have been losers (i.e. hit my stop losses). 

So, what happened? This weekend I've gone over my strategies and reasonings for trades and see why they failed. Did I change something? Have I been overlooking something important? Why are my recent trades doing so badly?

After much analysis the main reason my trades are doing badly is because of currency's misalignment with the fundamentals. Chinese economy is performing and yet AUD rose to a 7-month high. UK numbers are terrible (PMIs, jobs, and Brexit) and yet GPB climbs 400 pips, EBC declares their most aggressive ever surpassing everyone's expectations and yet Euro goes from 1.08 to 1.12. USDJPY rose 300 pips when negative rates were announces and then fell 1000 pips in the days that followed with no retracement in the days that followed.

These are the changes I will be making in my trading strategy going forward. First of all, I will put more emphasis on trend than fundamentals. I've always traded with fundamentals first, then technicals. I will only trade when the trend agrees with my fundamentals and then use technicals for entries and exits. This means I will be trading 2-3 times per week as I did in 2015 instead of 5-6 times.  8 of the 20 losses I had were GBPUSD, so, I will avoid trading that for now. 

After doing some pos-trade analysis on my losing trades, I noticed that if I had flipped my trades (after stops) 9/10 would have been winners. This has been a challenging 6 weeks. I was more resolute in putting trades on and now I've bee second guessing myself.

First of all, I want to mention that yes, I do run a website, and yes, I do run a service (neither of which I'm promoting on here, nor will I respond to PM's). But I offer the one thing that all ""professional traders"" don't. 

**My Site and Service will always be free (That means I pay for it, not you)**

All I am providing through here is charts, updates, levels, and potential ideas with a reasonable entry, and exit. 

Now, let's talk AUDUSD:

After a hell of a good week last week, with a big build up of bullish momentum, we're now sitting on support. The beginning of the week started off quite rough with a nice little drop. But on the weekly, it looks like it's just a pullback. As long as we hold this support, we could be seeing a new high this week. I'm long, I'm not advising people to be long, short, you can trade at your own risk. But what I am saying; is that ""if I were to place an order, I wouldn't want to see it below 0.7426 support. Losing that support will absorb all the bullish momentum that we're currently holding. But, if we hold this support that we're sitting on, the bigger time frame momentum could kick in and bring us to a new high this week. 

edit: **I would never advise buying at resistance, or selling at support. With that being said... If you're going to look for a long on AUD pairs, wait for a drop to a level you can identify before you enter - and don't ever blindly enter a trade because someone else says so, do your homework first.**

Here are corresponding charts to follow: http://imgur.com/a/DtviP

#**Update:**

If we can close above the lower line, which is the open of the candle that gave the move down. We should chop around up here for the rest of the night and try for the new high. 

If we don't close at least above that line, we're going to test what was gained from this morning

If we close above the doji (the higher line) it should be clear sailing to a new high.

*****

Trade the financial markets, specifically Forex trading. It's a fkin trillion dollar industry! There are a plethora of businesses online that sell software to meet the trading/investment needs of various demanding clients.

Just look up online EAs (Expert Advisor, which is automated/algorithmic trading, for Meta Trader 4), verify results using the myfxbook website (i.e. a reputable independent third-party website that certifies and tracks the record/performance of various trading strategies/systems, including commercial EAs), purchase the EA, verify results again by running/performing both a backtest and a forward test (i.e. paper trading on a demo account), and then, and only then can/should you use the EA with real money trading on a live/real account.

You can verify the EA's reliability by performing a backtest for a ""significant"" time period (for example 5-10 years; or depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA) coupled with 2-3 months of forward testing (i.e. paper trading on a demo account) and if the results are ""consistently"" profitable (i.e. ""overall consistent"" ""monthly"" profits from both backtesting and forward testing) with drawdowns being not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent"", then you can go live and trade using real money.

It's okay to expect a particular trading strategy/system to expire (i.e. lose its edge, or for profits to weaken/deteriorate/diminish). When that time comes, simply go onto the next “hot/trendy” EA or if you were fortunate enough to accumulate significant profits, you can store those profits in an interest-savings account and receive periodic income that way.

The purpose of backtesting and forward testing is to ensure drawdowns are not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent"", AND that there is proper risk management ""embedded within the EA"", thus minimizing/avoiding the risk of ""extreme"" drawdown or ""extreme"" losses when using real money.

Note: The switch to ""another"" hot/trendy EA should be made when the profits earned from the ""current"" EA have reached a point/level where it no longer appeals to the individual's interest/preference. However, if there is an ""unusual/unexpected/unanticipated"" ""significant"" drawdown (according to the performed backtest and forward test), then that would unfortunately represent an actual/real risk/loss incurred by the individual (and would still require a switch to another hot/trendy EA). This risk can be ""mitigated/minimized"" by performing a backtest ""AND"" a forward test (both for a ""significant"" time period, i.e. depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA), AND by conducting a proper psychological evaluation of the EA seller (as an ""individual"" entity), i.e. evaluating their reliability, logic, and confidence when it comes to addressing/answering relevant/crucial questions pertaining to Forex/Finance/Trading/Investing (rather than asking for or needing specific details regarding their intellectual property or proprietary strategy/system/software, i.e. their source code or trading methodology).

Ultimately, it comes down to “risk tolerance” while taking into account the results obtained from backtesting and forward testing, as well as the level of confidence and trust you impart/place on the person/group selling/distributing the EA.

Note: refer to the Investopedia website for definitions on the following terminology/vocabulary: backtesting, forward testing (i.e. paper trading on a demo account), drawdown (DD), maximum drawdown (MDD or MaxDD), and monthly/annual ROI (return on investment, as a percentage).

Also, note: ""focus"" on testing for maximum drawdown (MDD or MaxDD) (making sure drawdowns are not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent""; for example, not greater than 30%-50%, depending on your risk tolerance or preference) and looking for a ""track-record"" of ""overall consistent"" ""monthly"" profits from both backtesting and forward testing, i.e. paper trading on a demo account (both for a ""significant"" time period, depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA). This ""track-record"" can be ""verified"" either through the ""myfxbook"" website or through the combined use of backtesting and forward testing.

Each and every year, students graduate from college and university. How is it ""economically feasible"" to provide jobs for all or most of these people? My understanding is that people need to display a good understanding of the psychology of first impression, which includes genuine/authentic personality, trustworthiness, and competency (reflected in education); in other words, honest, reliable, and competent in relevant matters, or integrity, energy, and intelligence. 

Problem: The individual's attainment of their “desired dream/career job"", which is their ultimate purpose for pursuing ""rigorous"" higher education (i.e. college or university) or ""rigorous"" professional education (i.e. apprenticeship or trades).

I believe that a lot of people attend college and university with the hope that they will obtain a job after they graduate, a job that will support them financially. If money is the primary reason for their pursuing higher/professional education, shouldn't they be ""informed"" (as part of a global/collective civic/social responsibility) that there are alternative ways of making money (personally, namely, trading the financial markets), ones that will actually lead them to, or at least have a higher probability of leading them to, financial independence/prosperity, since the chances of them achieving such goal upon graduation from college/university is realistically slim – if not the problem of difficulty finding employment related to their “desired career/dream job”, then the problem of a dead-end mediocre job with a “fixed” “small” salary?

Should we, as a society, steer people away from college/university, often temporarily, since, let's be honest, our society is currently producing ""a lot"" of ""mediocre"" individuals with no real chance of obtaining a job that they were initially in pursuit of? Can we, as a society, do a better job of ""realizing"" and ""maximizing"" the talents/skills of these ""mediocre"" individuals, i.e. individuals who have no real chance of obtaining a job which they had been (or currently are) pursuing/studying rigorously for?

After going through a proper evaluation of current circumstances and current options, I've realized that people need to get certain things in their life straight ""before"" working on pursuing higher/professional education – i.e. Health > Wealth > Education/”Prestige”. 

The mass of people who pursue college and university because their program is in high demand are ones that are studying the program not for its unique intricacies, but rather only for graduation with the expectation that they ""deserve"" to be rewarded a job. As opposed to, respect and appreciation to the language their subject takes on (whether that be Accounting language or Computer Programming language, etc.). Respect and appreciation for a subject or field is displayed when the person engages with the subject or field with a “critical thinking” mindset, with the main purpose/goal of analyzing and critiquing thoroughly the accuracy of any statement presented to them that is related to their chosen subject or field, i.e. effectively utilizing journaling and documentation (see relevant section below, point #1 of 2 under “ESSENTIAL/CRUCIAL” for more details); this main purpose/goal is often rooted from a genuine desire/interest/passion for pursuing/studying their chosen subject or field.

The simple fact remains that it is simply not economically feasible to provide jobs to meet the constant influx of supply being produced by colleges and universities, ""each"" and ""every"" year. As a result, why are people making the foolish decision to incur immense amount of “DEBT” (keyword) while pursuing higher/professional education when the economic reality simply does not provide enough jobs for society, i.e. jobs that are specifically expected of from college and university graduates?

Quoted from someone else: ""Our societies have for so long told us that education can and should equate to professional success, which should equate to economic success, yet we are entering a period where that simply can't occur. The foundation that those notions were created upon doesn't exist any longer, given how we have evolved and grown as a species, and we have yet to make the transition to a new set of notions.""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some ESSENTIAL/CRUCIAL characteristics of an individual who exhibits genuine desire/interest/passion for pursuing/studying their chosen subject/field (especially at the higher education or professional education level) are as follows:

1) Effective ""Information Management"" strategy (utilizing journaling and documentation). The individual had made it a priority to create and compile personal notes or online documents for the purpose of future-reference and documentation – for potential revision, self-reflection, self-correction, or discovery, as this is crucial for knowledge retrieval, knowledge retention, as well as knowledge synthesis and creating/generating new knowledge. Note: information becomes knowledge when you regard the information as valuable and when you make the conscious decision to keep it as part of your notes with the expectation/option of using it in the future; knowledge is information in action, so actually using the information, instead of dismissing it as irrelevant. 

-->Response from another individual/writer:

* I don't mean that all information has to be kept as notes, nor that other strategies/tactics of finding/retrieving information aren't valuable. I don't even mean that it's impossible for someone to exist/operate without ever taking any notes. Most saliently, I'm more saying that to categorically omit note-taking from one's information management capabilities/strategy is to invite unnecessary trouble, likely to the point of dysfunction, unless one happens to never be doing anything that involves any significantly elusive information to begin with.

* My bias toward this assessment is reinforced by 25+ years of highly-technical work that has resulted in literally thousands (or tens-of-thousands) of pieces of information, extremely valuable to me, that can't be readily found anywhere but in my notes.

* Some of it is information specifically originating with myself – there's no one or nowhere else from which it can be gotten. Some of it is information that took me immense amounts of time, thought, and effort to find/acquire, and I would never want to have to try to find it again. Most of these things are in my notes because they have either already disappeared, or are likely to disappear, off of the internet, or don't lend themselves well to simple bookmark-able reference.

* Another way of saying this is that personally-kept notes are a reflection of the time/effort/insight one has had to put into acquiring the information, combined with the value of retrieval efficiency (organized for one's own retrieval needs). To subject yourself to relying on reproduction of that time/effort and self-organization is to either admit that the time/effort isn't significant (i.e. the information is rather trivial or ubiquitous in nature), or that your own time/effort spent isn't worth much (if you're willing to repeat it).

* Also, if one assumes that the information is always going to be right where you can easily find it, or even right where you found it before, that's actually just naive.

* While its true you still need to expend time/effort into locating the info, it has been organized specifically how YOU determine it should be, and thus truncates any actual ""overhead"" involved in the typical ""location"" process, not to mention the guarantee that it's actually there to find. Note: overhead expense refers to an ongoing expense of operating a business; it is also known as an ""operating expense"".

* As a simple/clear example: if you've never spent hours sifting through the deluge from the Google sewer pipe flooding into your browser, just to find anything remotely relevant to the fairly elusive technical scenario you're trying to resolve, then you're probably not acquainted with really anything I'm talking about, and your dismissal would then represent simply being unaware.

2) The individual is ASSERTIVE and NOT PASSIVE towards the subject they are studying. They are WILLING to articulate and share important ideas and concepts from the subject they are studying. The individual is not seen as someone who is under the spell/act (i.e. false and disingenuous impression of superior intelligence) of mindless regurgitation but rather, the individual is able to offer their OWN UNIQUE interpretation on the subject they are studying, while also citing important concepts or ideas where citation is necessary. In other words, the individual demonstrates ""individual competency"" THROUGH the subject they are studying and are ultimately/inherently passionate about. The individual's competency (i.e. his/her opinion or interpretation of what is relevant or accurate information) is demonstrated through the individual's pattern of logical and coherent thinking, as well as through the individual's writing style (which displays ""CONFIDENCE"" in what the individual is presenting as relevant or accurate information).

Relevant response from another individual:

Decide where you fall on the self-directed spectrum.

Highly self-directed: technical books and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)

Average: an online community + curriculum like Free Code Camp or theodinproject.com

Not very self-directed: An in-person coding boot camp like Hack Reactor or App Academy; similar to “subpar/mediocre” college/university “classroom” learning.

There are only so many ways of acquiring wealth (with only some methods actually leading to long-term/sustainable financial independence/prosperity):

1) Real Estate

2) Owning a business; being an entrepreneur

3) Career Job requiring higher education (i.e. college or university) or professional education (i.e. apprenticeship or trades) 

4) Minimum Wage Jobs

5) Trading the financial markets; making financial “investments” (stocks, forex, futures, options, equities, commodities, etc.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pseudo-Intellectual versus Intellectual (the following is a response from another individual/writer):

An intellectual follows the values and attitudes of Critical Thinking, and exercises good thinking habits. Their interest lies in discovery and self-correction. 

The traits of a true intellectual are as follows:

* intellectual humility – recognizing the limits and sensitivities of one's experience.

* intellectual courage – ability to examine things and/or state results or potentialities, even if it may be costly/risky to your personal beliefs, or social acceptance, established norms or theories. The ability to put things at risk. Even if they are your own cherished ideas or beliefs that you are putting at risk.

* intellectual empathy – knowing that you have to imaginatively put yourself in the place of others in order to understand them.

* intellectual autonomy – being able to think independently, to carry through without constant guidance from others, and sometimes even to come to different conclusions.

* intellectual integrity – holding yourself to the same standards you hold others, and holding all beliefs to the same standards.

* intellectual honesty – being willing to admit discrepancies and avoid overlooking exceptions, even to oneself.

* intellectual perseverance – having the patience to struggle through difficult or complex problems.

* confidence in reason – willingness to follow the logic where-ever it leads.

* fair-mindedness – avoiding making unjustified special exceptions or privileges. Holding all viewpoints to the same standards. This does not mean that all views are equal; it means they all are held to the same universal standards. They might end up meeting those standards very unequally. For instance: the theory of evolution vs the fable of creation, or climate change vs science denialism.

A pseudo-intellectual does not do these things. Their interest lies not in discovery and self-correction, but in confirmation of what is already believed. Confirmation Bias. Their ""thinking"" style is characterized by cognitive biases, a lack of self-reflection/self-correction, a lack of rigor and completeness, and applying woefully different standards to beliefs/ideas that they cherish, and any information that calls them into question.

1582,2016-03-23,Lots of questions and thoughts about central banks/fundamentals.,"Hi everyone, in this post I will dump some of my thoughts and questions regarding fundamentals. I think I’m not the only fundamental noob who has these questionmarks in his mind. It will relatively be a long post so brace yourself :)

Before, I wasn’t interacting with fundamentals seriously, I was just looking at NFP and CPI numbers and making some poor deductions based on FOMC statements. But then I realized how I ignored this crucial part of trading and then decided to learn more about fundamentals and encountered with some problems throughout the way. I will be grateful if experienced traders/investors enlighten me.

So, let’s start with the latest FOMC statement. I try to be as straight-forward as I can. Past week FOMC statement was quite dovish compared to market expectations, Yellen explicitly stated her concerns about global financial risks and Fed also downgraded its GDP and PCE projections. Before that Mario dropped a nuke. So it would be fair to say that EUR is bullish and USD is bearish. 

At this point I have these questions:

* Since Fed ignored the strong data coming from US and started to think about global risks, does that mean that fed’s future monetary policy is strictly tied to factors like Europe and China ?

* Does downgrading or upgrading the projections affect the market ? (I think it does.)

* PCE constantly increased for the last 3 months but CPI decreased last month however Fed considered CPI as increasing gradually. Does Fed ignore the latest decrease ? And by the way specifically which inflation data is important for Fed? Yearly Core, Monthly Core, CPI, PPI, PCE?

* Does the first reaction of market indicate future sentiment and trend ? And if it does, is there any way that I can learn how long the sentiment lasts ?

* What are the roles of forecasts, let’s assume the previous cpi number is 1.2 and our forecast is 1.5 but the actual number came as 1.3 . How would this affect the market ? It’s a common phenomenon since forecasts are rarely correct.

* There are couple of GDP, unemployment and inflation data on the table (such as: Jobless claims, ISM manuf.- non manuf. - SA, Unemployment rate, NFP, GDP y/y-q/q-m/m | annualized-price index etc...) which are the ones that central banks take into consideration ?


Moving on... This week we had lots of opportunity to listen the both FOMC and ECB members. While I was expecting a bullish momentum on EUR/USD because of the latest statements etc. but dollar didn’t give a fuck. 

* Inspite of the fact that Fed lowered its projections and came with a dovish statement Lockhart+Harker+Williams+Evans and Bullard come with hawkish comments. Since Evans and Harker is not even a voting member how their statements made so much bullish effect on USD ? Or the recent sentiment was the consequence of Brexit and Brussels attack ?

* Can we say that Yellen’s and Mario’s statements created a macro sentiment but FOMC members triggered an intraday sentiment ?

* How strong are those FOMC members’ comments really ?

* What’s the deal with the dot plotting stuff ? I know that it’s a interest rate forecast sheet that the members are plotted as dots. I think it’s not important but Evans and Bullard mentioned about it.

* Also did Lautenschlaeger explicitly state that ECB could go lower with rates or I get that wrong ?


It's hard to comprehend the reactions of market to such news. I hope they are clear and easy to understand. 

Thanks in advance,

1584,2016-03-25,COMPREHENSIVE Forex Trading SOLUTION/ANSWER; FEEDBACK NEEDED,"The following is a comprehensive response outlining a viable, reasonable, scalable, and sustainable solution for achieving financial independence/prosperity. Please let me know what you think as I would appreciate your feedback.

*****

Trade the financial markets, specifically Forex trading. It's a fkin trillion dollar industry! There are a plethora of businesses online that sell software to meet the trading/investment needs of various demanding clients.

Just look up online EAs (Expert Advisor, which is automated/algorithmic trading, for Meta Trader 4), verify results using the myfxbook website (i.e. a reputable independent third-party website that certifies and tracks the record/performance of various trading strategies/systems, including commercial EAs), purchase the EA, verify results again by running/performing both a backtest and a forward test (i.e. paper trading on a demo account), and then, and only then can/should you use the EA with real money trading on a live/real account.

You can verify the EA's reliability by performing a backtest for a ""significant"" time period (for example 5-10 years; or depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA) coupled with 2-3 months of forward testing (i.e. paper trading on a demo account) and if the results are ""consistently"" profitable (i.e. ""overall consistent"" ""monthly"" profits from both backtesting and forward testing) with drawdowns being not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent"", then you can go live and trade using real money.

It's okay to expect a particular trading strategy/system to expire (i.e. lose its edge, or for profits to weaken/deteriorate/diminish). When that time comes, simply go onto the next “hot/trendy” EA or if you were fortunate enough to accumulate significant profits, you can store those profits in an interest-savings account and receive periodic income that way.

The purpose of backtesting and forward testing is to ensure drawdowns are not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent"", AND that there is proper risk management ""embedded within the EA"", thus minimizing/avoiding the risk of ""extreme"" drawdown or ""extreme"" losses when using real money.

Note: The switch to ""another"" hot/trendy EA should be made when the profits earned from the ""current"" EA have reached a point/level where it no longer appeals to the individual's interest/preference. However, if there is an ""unusual/unexpected/unanticipated"" ""significant"" drawdown (according to the performed backtest and forward test), then that would unfortunately represent an actual/real risk/loss incurred by the individual (and would still require a switch to another hot/trendy EA). This risk can be ""mitigated/minimized"" by performing a backtest ""AND"" a forward test (both for a ""significant"" time period, i.e. depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA), AND by conducting a proper psychological evaluation of the EA seller (as an ""individual"" entity), i.e. evaluating their reliability, logic, and confidence when it comes to addressing/answering relevant/crucial questions pertaining to Forex/Finance/Trading/Investing (rather than asking for or needing specific details regarding their intellectual property or proprietary strategy/system/software, i.e. their source code or trading methodology).

Ultimately, it comes down to “risk tolerance” while taking into account the results obtained from backtesting and forward testing, as well as the level of confidence and trust you impart/place on the person/group selling/distributing the EA.

Note: refer to the Investopedia website for definitions on the following terminology/vocabulary: backtesting, forward testing (i.e. paper trading on a demo account), drawdown (DD), maximum drawdown (MDD or MaxDD), and monthly/annual ROI (return on investment, as a percentage).

Also, note: ""focus"" on testing for maximum drawdown (MDD or MaxDD) (making sure drawdowns are not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent""; for example, not greater than 30%-50%, depending on your risk tolerance or preference) and looking for a ""track-record"" of ""overall consistent"" ""monthly"" profits from both backtesting and forward testing, i.e. paper trading on a demo account (both for a ""significant"" time period, depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA). This ""track-record"" can be ""verified"" either through the ""myfxbook"" website or through the combined use of backtesting and forward testing.

Each and every year, students graduate from college and university. How is it ""economically feasible"" to provide jobs for all or most of these people? My understanding is that people need to display a good understanding of the psychology of first impression, which includes genuine/authentic personality, trustworthiness, and competency (reflected in education); in other words, honest, reliable, and competent in relevant matters, or integrity, energy, and intelligence. 

Problem: The individual's attainment of their “desired dream/career job"", which is their ultimate purpose for pursuing ""rigorous"" higher education (i.e. college or university) or ""rigorous"" professional education (i.e. apprenticeship or trades).

I believe that a lot of people attend college and university with the hope that they will obtain a job after they graduate, a job that will support them financially. If money is the primary reason for their pursuing higher/professional education, shouldn't they be ""informed"" (as part of a global/collective civic/social responsibility) that there are alternative ways of making money (personally, namely, trading the financial markets), ones that will actually lead them to, or at least have a higher probability of leading them to, financial independence/prosperity, since the chances of them achieving such goal upon graduation from college/university is realistically slim – if not the problem of difficulty finding employment related to their “desired career/dream job”, then the problem of a dead-end mediocre job with a “fixed” “small” salary?

Should we, as a society, steer people away from college/university, often temporarily, since, let's be honest, our society is currently producing ""a lot"" of ""mediocre"" individuals with no real chance of obtaining a job that they were initially in pursuit of? Can we, as a society, do a better job of ""realizing"" and ""maximizing"" the talents/skills of these ""mediocre"" individuals, i.e. individuals who have no real chance of obtaining a job which they had been (or currently are) pursuing/studying rigorously for?

After going through a proper evaluation of current circumstances and current options, I've realized that people need to get certain things in their life straight ""before"" working on pursuing higher/professional education – i.e. Health > Wealth > Education/”Prestige”. 

The mass of people who pursue college and university because their program is in high demand are ones that are studying the program not for its unique intricacies, but rather only for graduation with the expectation that they ""deserve"" to be rewarded a job. As opposed to, respect and appreciation to the language their subject takes on (whether that be Accounting language or Computer Programming language, etc.). Respect and appreciation for a subject or field is displayed when the person engages with the subject or field with a “critical thinking” mindset, with the main purpose/goal of analyzing and critiquing thoroughly the accuracy of any statement presented to them that is related to their chosen subject or field, i.e. effectively utilizing journaling and documentation (see relevant section below, point #1 of 2 under “ESSENTIAL/CRUCIAL” for more details); this main purpose/goal is often rooted from a genuine desire/interest/passion for pursuing/studying their chosen subject or field.

The simple fact remains that it is simply not economically feasible to provide jobs to meet the constant influx of supply being produced by colleges and universities, ""each"" and ""every"" year. As a result, why are people making the foolish decision to incur immense amount of “DEBT” (keyword) while pursuing higher/professional education when the economic reality simply does not provide enough jobs for society, i.e. jobs that are specifically expected of from college and university graduates?

Quoted from someone else: ""Our societies have for so long told us that education can and should equate to professional success, which should equate to economic success, yet we are entering a period where that simply can't occur. The foundation that those notions were created upon doesn't exist any longer, given how we have evolved and grown as a species, and we have yet to make the transition to a new set of notions.""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some ESSENTIAL/CRUCIAL characteristics of an individual who exhibits genuine desire/interest/passion for pursuing/studying their chosen subject/field (especially at the higher education or professional education level) are as follows:

1) Effective ""Information Management"" strategy (utilizing journaling and documentation). The individual had made it a priority to create and compile personal notes or online documents for the purpose of future-reference and documentation – for potential revision, self-reflection, self-correction, or discovery, as this is crucial for knowledge retrieval, knowledge retention, as well as knowledge synthesis and creating/generating new knowledge. Note: information becomes knowledge when you regard the information as valuable and when you make the conscious decision to keep it as part of your notes with the expectation/option of using it in the future; knowledge is information in action, so actually using the information, instead of dismissing it as irrelevant. 

-->Response from another individual/writer:

* I don't mean that all information has to be kept as notes, nor that other strategies/tactics of finding/retrieving information aren't valuable. I don't even mean that it's impossible for someone to exist/operate without ever taking any notes. Most saliently, I'm more saying that to categorically omit note-taking from one's information management capabilities/strategy is to invite unnecessary trouble, likely to the point of dysfunction, unless one happens to never be doing anything that involves any significantly elusive information to begin with.

* My bias toward this assessment is reinforced by 25+ years of highly-technical work that has resulted in literally thousands (or tens-of-thousands) of pieces of information, extremely valuable to me, that can't be readily found anywhere but in my notes.

* Some of it is information specifically originating with myself – there's no one or nowhere else from which it can be gotten. Some of it is information that took me immense amounts of time, thought, and effort to find/acquire, and I would never want to have to try to find it again. Most of these things are in my notes because they have either already disappeared, or are likely to disappear, off of the internet, or don't lend themselves well to simple bookmark-able reference.

* Another way of saying this is that personally-kept notes are a reflection of the time/effort/insight one has had to put into acquiring the information, combined with the value of retrieval efficiency (organized for one's own retrieval needs). To subject yourself to relying on reproduction of that time/effort and self-organization is to either admit that the time/effort isn't significant (i.e. the information is rather trivial or ubiquitous in nature), or that your own time/effort spent isn't worth much (if you're willing to repeat it).

* Also, if one assumes that the information is always going to be right where you can easily find it, or even right where you found it before, that's actually just naive.

* While its true you still need to expend time/effort into locating the info, it has been organized specifically how YOU determine it should be, and thus truncates any actual ""overhead"" involved in the typical ""location"" process, not to mention the guarantee that it's actually there to find. Note: overhead expense refers to an ongoing expense of operating a business; it is also known as an ""operating expense"".

* As a simple/clear example: if you've never spent hours sifting through the deluge from the Google sewer pipe flooding into your browser, just to find anything remotely relevant to the fairly elusive technical scenario you're trying to resolve, then you're probably not acquainted with really anything I'm talking about, and your dismissal would then represent simply being unaware.

2) The individual is ASSERTIVE and NOT PASSIVE towards the subject they are studying. They are WILLING to articulate and share important ideas and concepts from the subject they are studying. The individual is not seen as someone who is under the spell/act (i.e. false and disingenuous impression of superior intelligence) of mindless regurgitation but rather, the individual is able to offer their OWN UNIQUE interpretation on the subject they are studying, while also citing important concepts or ideas where citation is necessary. In other words, the individual demonstrates ""individual competency"" THROUGH the subject they are studying and are ultimately/inherently passionate about. The individual's competency (i.e. his/her opinion or interpretation of what is relevant or accurate information) is demonstrated through the individual's pattern of logical and coherent thinking, as well as through the individual's writing style (which displays ""CONFIDENCE"" in what the individual is presenting as relevant or accurate information).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relevant response from another individual:

Decide where you fall on the self-directed spectrum.

Highly self-directed: technical books and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)

Average: an online community + curriculum like Free Code Camp or theodinproject.com

Not very self-directed: An in-person coding boot camp like Hack Reactor or App Academy; similar to “subpar/mediocre” college/university “classroom” learning.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are only so many ways of acquiring wealth (with only some methods actually leading to long-term/sustainable financial independence/prosperity):

1) Real Estate

2) Owning a business; being an entrepreneur

3) Career Job requiring higher education (i.e. college or university) or professional education (i.e. apprenticeship or trades) 

4) Minimum Wage Jobs

5) Trading the financial markets; making financial “investments” (stocks, forex, futures, options, equities, commodities, etc.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pseudo-Intellectual versus Intellectual (the following is a response from another individual/writer):

An intellectual follows the values and attitudes of Critical Thinking, and exercises good thinking habits. Their interest lies in discovery and self-correction. 

The traits of a true intellectual are as follows:

* intellectual humility – recognizing the limits and sensitivities of one's experience.

* intellectual courage – ability to examine things and/or state results or potentialities, even if it may be costly/risky to your personal beliefs, or social acceptance, established norms or theories. The ability to put things at risk. Even if they are your own cherished ideas or beliefs that you are putting at risk.

* intellectual empathy – knowing that you have to imaginatively put yourself in the place of others in order to understand them.

* intellectual autonomy – being able to think independently, to carry through without constant guidance from others, and sometimes even to come to different conclusions.

* intellectual integrity – holding yourself to the same standards you hold others, and holding all beliefs to the same standards.

* intellectual honesty – being willing to admit discrepancies and avoid overlooking exceptions, even to oneself.

* intellectual perseverance – having the patience to struggle through difficult or complex problems.

* confidence in reason – willingness to follow the logic where-ever it leads.

* fair-mindedness – avoiding making unjustified special exceptions or privileges. Holding all viewpoints to the same standards. This does not mean that all views are equal; it means they all are held to the same universal standards. They might end up meeting those standards very unequally. For instance: the theory of evolution vs the fable of creation, or climate change vs science denialism.

A pseudo-intellectual does not do these things. Their interest lies not in discovery and self-correction, but in confirmation of what is already believed. Confirmation Bias. Their ""thinking"" style is characterized by cognitive biases, a lack of self-reflection/self-correction, a lack of rigor and completeness, and applying woefully different standards to beliefs/ideas that they cherish, and any information that calls them into question.

I'm not sure if I was as prepared as I should have been before I started trading. I made a practice account and have studied and practiced hard for 3+ months before putting real money in. My practice account is looking great with profits. This all changed when I started trading with real money.

It seems that every time I look at a trend, make an informed decision including news, etc. As soon as I buy or sell, it will jump the opposite direction within seconds, instantly leaving me with a (sometimes huge) loss. If I try to ride it out, I just lose more.

Example: I lost close to $400 this morning in 10 minutes on 1 trade after seeing a 4 day downtrend on USD/CAD. I put my sell order for 35,000 at 1.28575. Well at 1.28562 it decides to shoot way up. I tried to ride it out and decided this wouldn't be a huge spike upwards.. It was. It went up to 1.29703, over 100 pips. So, I took my losses and bought. I happened to buy at 1.29700, 3 pips before it fell again. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but it's pissing me off horribly. I know this is the risk that we all take when getting into Forex but I can't believe I hit the end of a 4 day trend within seconds.

*** Edit: I want to thank you all for your advice. I took it slower and more carefully yesterday and ended up with a $45 profit! I have a lot more to learn but y'all have been extremely helpful. This is a great community and I just want to say thanks! ***

All I'm trying to say is I respect anyone who can make money with this. I've lost $1200+ of my $1800 that I started with in 4 days, seemingly on flukes, possibly due to bad decisions. I'm going to take a break for a few weeks and try to see where I've gone wrong. Any suggestions would be helpful.

1599,2016-04-03,"My ""Wave"" Strategy (For those who've been asking)","Hey everyone. I wanted to share my strategy here, because a few have asked and I'm happy to do so.

I'm not a professional trader, and I didn't make this all up myself. I cobbled together a few bits and pieces I found useful, and combined it into something that suits how I like to trade.

It is a trend following strategy that can be used to capture the initial large trend move, enter an existing trend on retracements with high accuracy, or even to trade a range more reliably and with confidence.  It has a win rate of around 65% on some pairs, and can generate around 10% per month (annualized from a year's testing results) per pair. 

In the wild, actual results may vary. On that note, I'd be very interested if anyone thinks it could be turned into a robot.

Without further ado, here's a picture of how it looks on a 4HR chart: http://i.imgur.com/lIWam2g.png

And here's what goes into it and how to trade it.


**Timeframes and Prep**

As far as I know, this should work on all timeframes. However, it seems to be most profitable on the 1Hr and most stable on the 4hr charts. I prefer 1Hr lately.

BUT, your analysis should always start with the daily chart or higher. Cycle through them, identify the direction of the main trend. Mark out the support and resistance levels - the usual stuff. 

**The entire strategy revolves around trading the break of a smaller trend, in the direction of the larger trend or towards the opposite side of a range**
That's super important. We don't trade levels so much as price, and we trade that trend until the candle colour tells us not to.

**Best pairs to trade:** USD/JPY, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, EUR/JPY

**The Indicators** - (All of which are free and available for multiple platforms)

The entire strategy is based around the 34EMA, but before we get to that:

* Add some other MAs. I have the 14ema, and the 50, 100 and 200 SMAs. Which ones isn't so important, as long as they help you to see the general direction of the trend. The 14ema can be used to capture very fast moving trends, but I mostly use it as a visual aid and an early warning sign of trend changes.
* Prepare your chart: set it to black and white, and in the properties menu somewhere, **disable ""show chart on foreground"". THIS IS IMPORTANT**
* Next is the funky coloured candles. I'll explain those in a bit. Download [Raghee Horner's GRaB and Wave](http://simplerforex.com/home-page-members/start-here/) - if that link dies in the future just google it. It's all over the place as well as lots of videos on using it. 
* To set up the candles, drag each one onto the chart, open it, and set the bar width to 2. Fiddle with the colours if it pleases you.
* Lastly, and this isn't essential but I like it, [download Rob Booker's Knoxville Divergence indicator.](http://tfl365.com/kx-2/). That's the green/red lines and arrows you see. It's free. Add it to your chart and set the ""lookback"" to 50. Don't change anything else.

**Putting it all together**

What you have, with all of those together, is a nice visual way of identifying trend direction, support and resistance, and chances of being oversold/overbought and due for a reversal.

***Central to it all is the ""Wave*""**. This is the 34ema on the high, low and close - the 3 grey lines. This provides dynamic support/resistance in a trending market, and oscillates around the midpoint in a ranging market. It indicates when price is generally bullish or bearish on that timeframe. 

The candles are my favourite bit. Green when above the 34ema, red below, and blue in the middle. Not much to say there - it's visual and I like it, but it isn't a strategy on its own.

Lastly, the ""Knoxville Divergence"" indicator. This I borrowed from Rob Booker. It combines multiple oscillators to indicate multiple divergence, and prints ""reversal arrows"" when a reversal is likely. Now, this indicator is tricky so a word about it:

The green lines below price at lows (and red above at highs) are ""knoxville divergence"". As I said they are combine some oscillators to indicate overbought/oversold conditions. It's a very sensitive indicator and throws a lot of false positives. But the one we are looking for occurs at price extremes or range tops/bottoms, and looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/5kh1ajK.png

See how it's almost flat, and quite short, connecting 2 points that aren't far away from each other vertically? That's a good sign that a top is in place. When that happens after price has been moving in one direction for a long time, it's a good sign that it's not safe to trade in the direction of the trend anymore. We might want to look for a reversal rather (as you can see in the example)

**The reversal arrows are not signals.** They are printed once divergence has happened and a larger-than-average candle prints in the opposite direction of the trend. Again, these are just guides, but I don't pay much attention to them. 

**Taking a Trade**

Let's look at the example I originally posted of the [GBP/USD 4hr chart.](http://i.imgur.com/lIWam2g.png). 

First, we were in a down trend and have since moved into a kind of sloppy range. We're trying to find a timeframe where there is a trend. Since we're in a range on the 4hr chart, we go down to the 1HR chart, where you can see the trade I took on Friday before NFPs.

http://i.imgur.com/AieiE1g.png

Let's look at the elements as a checklist:

* Higher timeframe: Range
* 1HR timeframe: At the top of range - look for a sell trade
* Knoxville Divergence: the good kind we like, just the day before
* **Trend Line** Great big one. This is really important - we want to see classic support breaking as price breaks lower from the wave. 

We see these, then we see a break of the wave and trend line simultaneously. We won't always get this, but it's beautiful when it happens. 

Enter short here, with a stop about 10 pips above the yellow 50 simple moving average. The target is usually somewhere towards the bottom of the range. In this case I set it quite high cos it was NFP Friday and I wanted to be out of a winner or a loser by the end of the day. 

So that's an example of a range trade using the strategy. 

**The Trend Trade**

A trend trade is similar, but in this case we use the wave to establish when a counter-trend move like a bear flag/wedge/triangle is exhausted and breaking for real.

Here's a great example:

USDJPY 4hr: http://i.imgur.com/AieiE1g.png

So, here we have an extended counter trend move on the 4hr chart. That could be a trade on its own if you wanted to buy the break of the wave, but I don't like doing that so much. 

You can also take a short directly off the wave on the first touch, or on a reversal candle inside/out of the wave, but I found that to have a low success rate.

So now I wait for a consolidation pattern, usually a wedge or a flag, to form.  My checklist for a bearish trade would be:

* There has been a strong directional move from major consolidation on this timeframe.
* Price is consolidating and moving against the trend
* Price has risen to meet the wave, maybe even broken above it, but the major moving averages are still pointing down 
* MAs are getting kind of squished together (nice but not essential).
* Price breaks out of the consolidation pattern and the wave and closes a bar outside it. 

In this case, entry is the same as before.

**Money Management**

Money management is what turns this from an average strategy into a great one. The key is to ride the meat of a strong trend move, without getting bogged down in consolidation. Here's how I handle it.

* Risk up to 2% on a high-conviction move (trend continuations). Or 1% on range trades/reversals cos they tend to be choppier.
* Risk/Reward needs to be greater than 2:1. I usually look to see that there is at least 3 times the distance from price to the other side of the yellow MA (the stop distance) to go to the nearest swing low/high. Trail stop to breakeven if b/e is below yellow MA.
* In a range trade, take just a little less than half profit when price is 1.5x risk, and the rest at  around the 61.8 retracement or roughly 2/3rds the width of the range. Trail stop to breakeven if b/e is below yellow MA.
* For trend trades, take a little less than half profit when price is about 2x risk, or at recent swing low. Set main target ambitiously but within reason - it is a trend after all. 
* In a trend trade I will add if the pattern repeats itself and I get another entry. But ONLY if I have been able to take some profit, and trailed my stop. I will risk maximum 1% on adds, with a very wide stop (the second and third retracement of a trend tend to be deeper and spikier)

**Looks great, what could go wrong?**

Remember that GBP/USD chart?  Here's a picture of what I actually did on that day:

http://i.imgur.com/hWeeNko.png

What mistakes did I make here?  Let me list them:

1. Sold the break of the wave without trend break confirmation (got stopped out)
2. Convinced myself that NFPs would be terrible and that price was continuing the uptrend after a deeper than normal dip, and bought
3. Chopped around 2 more times because I can't draw a trend line
4. Eventually sold the break of the trend line I'd had on there since the beginning but had been too impatient to wait for
5. Broke even

I put this up to illustrate that this is not a simple strategy to follow. It requires discipline and adhering to the rules, and the right market conditions.

A few other things I can think of:

**Best pairs to trade:** USD/JPY, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, EUR/JPY

**Okay pairs to trade:** EUR/USD, , USD/CAD, AUD/JPY, GBP/JPY (be super careful - not on 1HR charts!), EUR/GBP

**Terrible pairs to trade:**  GBP/AUD, EUR/AUD, basically any crosses, most JPY pairs, anything with CHF in it. 

**Best days and times to trade:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday, once the US session kicks in (for 1Hr and lower - otherwise time of day matters less)

**Worst time to trade:** Thursdays.  Seriously I don't know what it is, but Thursdays are disasters for this strategy.

**What's the win rate?** Depends on the pair. But around 65% on GBP/USD, AUD/JPY and USD/USD. between 50 - 60% on the ""Okay"" pairs. That's usually plenty to make good money since our money management makes us the money.

**What's the edge?** I firmly believe that this strategy has 2 things that make it better than flipping a coin or just using classical chart patterns. And I consider that enough to to constitute an edge. These two things are:

1. A clear way of seeing the trend, with a better than average chance of indicating when a market might be starting a new trend or resuming an old one.
2. Money management that makes the winners very profitable while keeping the losses small when the market is not conducive to the strategy.

**What is the main weakness?** I discovered that this strategy does worst when the market changes from trending to ranging, and gets into a choppy range. The money management will keep your losses small while you take one or two losses to figure out that things have changed. That's what the divergence and reversal tabs are also for. When those things start showing up, you know to be careful and to expect a higher chance of price breaking to the other side of the wave and stopping you out.

That's about all I can think of to write for now. I hope you guys enjoyed it and if anyone has any questions, I'll be happy to answer them!",26,0.96

1625,2016-04-15,Forex experience so far,"  So I just thought I would just give an update about my forex trading experience so far. I currently trade on Oanda and have been rather satisfied with my experiences. I started on March first with 1,000 in my account and I currently have a net gain of 2,500. I have also withdrawn my original 1,000. So I would deffiently say it has been a good experience so far. I have also had my fair share of losses during the month but at least the wins came out on top. I would be interested to hear what some of your experiences have been.

Edit/Addition:          My strategy is still a work in progress. During the first weeks i had very poor money management skills that led to some losses. I quickly learned the importance of Stop loss and my best friend the trailing stop. For the most part i use the downtime on the weekends to do my analysis and make my trades through the week based on my diagnosis. I trade primarily the NZD/USD pair (I would also recommend other new traders to find a currency pair they like and try sticking to it and learning as much as possible about it) i use this pair because it has the most appropriate volatility for my strategy. I make an average of 1 or 2 trades a day and some days i will make zero trades. I wait until the currency is at the most volatile point of the day and then make my trade.
     I usually set my stop loss at 20 pips (providing I am not trading a related news event in which case i would increase it to about 30 or 35 pips) I then watch the market and if I reach 6 pips profit I place my stop loss to my entry point in case the market turns against my position i will then break even. I then continue to watch the market and  if i have moved to 12 pips of profit I set a trailing stop of 12 pips. After I have done this I will take no further action on my trade,  I then let the market run its course comfortable knowing that i am not at risk of any losses but still assume a position where i can accumulate any amount of potential profits.I still think I have many flaws in my strategy and I also feel that i am still assuming too much risk during each trade. It is still a work in process and I will be modifying it soon but so far it has seemed to work. The vast majority of my losses where for attempting to trade news events and most of my regular trades tend to break even or at a profit of 1 or 2 pips. But my success has been through the trailing stop and letting my winners ride to high profits. I would also say the most important things I have learned is not to trade based off of emotion and that losses are just a part of FOREX trading. I use the FX Trade platform on OANDA and strongly recommend using the app for price alerts. 
    Good luck to all and I will try to keep updates on any progress. Fell free to ask anymore questions and or critique my strategy because I know i still have much to learn.",18,0.88
1626,2016-04-15,FNG Friday Forex question,"Lurking for about a month, probably going to become a regular

TL;DR at bottom

a Quick word about my experience so far: 

I've been using a demo FXCM account for a little over a month (+/-). Initially treated it like gambling and was down about $1.5K mainly due to trading stupid large lots because...well, I could. I'm now trading nothing higher than 5 lots, or 50K  and working my way back to even. I've gone from -1.5K in the red to about 750-800 or so in the red. I plan on using real cash when I've gone a couple thousand dollars past break-even. There really is no rush for me, I have a job and don't really want to do this full time - Truthfully I simply find this to be a LOT of fun.

I do have some questions for you though if you'll humor me:

What type of trader are you and how did you choose your style? Swing, day, position, scalper, sniper, X, Y, Z...there are probably dozens of styles idk about even after all the reading I've done so far.

In this same vein, (I am NOT asking you to choose my style) If I am at work and unable to do anything but watch the market and any stop/limits i placed before I left get hit (can't have phone, can't download platform)...do you have any *suggestions* for a style that would mesh with that schedule? Maybe people who are/have been in the same boat?

All of my profitable trades so far have been ""guesses"" or based on (2 specific) candlestick patterns at 30m and up. There was what I took to be a dark cloud cover indicator on the 12th at noon on the EUR/USD at the 1h interval (if you wanted to see it) that I read correctly that got me a good 100+ pips or so, and the shooting star prior to that netted me another 60-70. So I guess I enjoy candlestick patterns? I'm really just trying to find my groove here, and looking for people who have already been there/done that. Other than that my trades basically boil down to guesses - and even if guessing can get me 2,500$ in the green I'm not going to put real cash in until it's not *just* a hunch.

Fib levels, line/trend indicators and bollinger bands. These are currently the only indicators I use, and truthfully I ""use"" them horribly. I know there are more indicators, but these two are what I want to learn right now. babypips has multiple pages of info, fxkeys has info, fxfornoobs, informedtrades, etc. they all have good information but it's just not clicking for me yet. I understand I've only been doing this for about 4-6 weeks and I don't expect to be an expert, but I don't like feeling dumb either. ANY help on these (especially reading them) would be appreciated...I'm still reading about them, but this shit just isn't clicking for me yet. Some ELI4 type stuff lol.

TL;DR - New trader, lost 1.5k with stupid large trades and multiple 1m/5m ""sniper"" style losses, made 700 back with reasonable sized trades, has no trading style at all yet other than minor candlestick pattern recognition, curious how others found their groove, wants to understand fib/bollinger bands much better/at all. I'm not looking to be spoon-fed information, there are just some things I haven't found an answer for, I simply don't understand yet, or would be best answered with actual experience.",2,0.75

1631,2016-04-18,My fav trades for the week and some swing trades.,"I'm new here but I'm going to start posting a weekly out look of my favorite positions I'm running in the book mostly will only cover the majors and some EM every once in a while. I will go over a few reasons why and my target and stops. Feel free to discuss and share your own ideas. 

£: Last week I put on a starter long around 1.41. I wanna see a more promising base and bottom before I put more size on my stop is around the low of the year. I'm also short the 1.53 June puts, I wouldn't advise having it on if your don't know what your doing because -gamma should keep you up at night  but after the brexit panic and Chinese fears that saw us sell of from 1.50 to 1.37 vol got really expensive so I'm looking for some mean reversion. I think ultimately England stays in the Union and that's an automatic relief rally to 1.50. The data is mixed out of the U.K. but if your in the camp that oil is bottoming then that should help us out in the inflation department in turn leading the CPI to tick up. If the data picks up which I think it will going into the end of the year we can probably find our selves with a more hawkish or should I say less dovish BoE board. The risk remain to the upside in my opinion and if we look at the COT report positioning would also support that. These CTA's have to take profit at some point and our next test of 1.45-1.46 should we hold the lows will see a nice short squeeze me thinks. I will be trading around this position for as long as it's on as I'm looking for 1.52-1.55 before I am completely liquidated.  I'm also getting short €/£ from  79-80 with a stop on a close above  81. The reasoning is somewhat similar to my long £/$ thesis. My target is 75-74. 

Aud: due to a bottom in oil, China fears taking a back seat in some sense, better data comjng from down under and a less dovish RBA we have had a nice rally. I think we see 80 sometime in the next 2 months with a new election and new RBA governer comjng on board in a month there is no way they cut rated but I like to make money on both sides so I'm short from .7697. I think we are a little over done and can move down to 74( Im long those puts as well) the risk reward for this trade i like. Trading against 78 and scaling in on rallies into 77s is the plan here. I think we get a tick up in vol and a move down in oil which puts this position in the perfect atmosphere to go down. I'm long some eur/aud and above 1.42 I'm a big fan of the swing. 

€: the euro I love if you follow me on Twitter you will see I've been long for almost a year now and I'm looking for 1.17. 1.15 is going soon so I like buying the dips. Once 1.15 goes we see 1.17 and if that goes then we get a squeeze to 1.20-1.22. My view for this week is to sell the rallies into 1.14. We have some single prints to clean up on the profile under 1.12 so that's where I'm looking. Haven't looked at the calendar yet but granite there is no big miss on us data my bet is we will print that mid week. 

Cad: this is just a proxy oil trade. The gap on the weekly is free money(front month contract on the futures 6C)  I'm a buyer  of dips in eur/cad and usd/cad. Above 1.40 and 1.35 respectively I like the swing trade. It's had a nice rally off the lows and the BoC is getting a tad dovish. 

Yen: I have no idea we have been long since June selling rallies as long as we didn't see a close above 125.50. We had a 105 target but we lightened up a little much at 110. The BOJ has to ease massively for this not to break 100. Sell rallies if you can get it at 115 and trade against 120. It's also just a proxy long vol which I like side imo we have a tough time in h2. 

$: my dollar out look is and will continue to be bearish until the facts change. Those facts are Janet yellen is worried about what rate hikes will do to the world economy. If she hikes she stirs up the China fears and send the dollar soaring. A strong $ is bad in her mind due to earnings headwinds, there is a ton of $ debt in EM as our $ rises the local currency gets tagged in turn making it harder to service the debt prices in $. Inflation is still not so good even tho Iswaps have ticked up as oil moved from the lows seen in February.  They can't hike for the same reason the RBA can't. A summer time hike is out of the question they are already worried about liquidity and we have an election a quarter later. Imo we would have to see some strong numbers for them to move anytime before December so that's what I am expecting 1 hike this year in q4 the same as last year. Sell the rallies but the weekly out look is up. 

This all for now let me know what you think and your opinion I love to hear where market participants are at in terms of directional views. 

My favorite trade for this year which I will be running in the long term book is aud/nzd it's going to 1.25. Rate differentials are all you need to know with this one. Kiwi sees another rate cut and if we don't see one coming from the RBA then we should trade above 1.15 sometime soon. 

That's it, let me know what you guys think and are looking at. I enjoy hearing both sides and if you disagree with me please open a dialogue and discuss the reasons why.  Hopefully we can get this forum more active and a place to share ideas an help keep each other from those pesky  drawdowns. ",15,0.9

1640,2016-04-21,Pip Value Quesgtion,"I just noticed pretty much all my trades 0.10 lot size does not = $1. For example on my last trade I made 47.2 pips my profit was $36.9 Shouldn't the profit be $46.34 if the commission is $0.86 per trade? I paid no Swap on the trade the only fee I paid was the commission. I emailed my broker and they said the pip value on that pair at the time was $0.782 per 0.10 lot size. How in the world did they come up with that amount with 0.10 lot size should equal $1 per pip not $0.782 per pip?

What's funny all my losses seem to calculate correctly for instance 

Example one losing trade  I lost 21.40 pips and at 0.10 lot size my loss was exactly -$21.40 which 0.10 equals exactly $1 per pip 

I  was down on another trade 23.3 pips my loss at 0.01 lot size was correct which was a loss of exactly -$2.33 0.01 equaled exactly $0.10 which is precisely what I was trained 1 pip at 0.01 should equal

Some of my losing trades the pip value was much much higher than 0.10 lot size = $1 it was like 0.10 = more than $1 making my loss much bigger! It's crazy how when I win a trade I get less profit per pip but when I lose a trade pip value goes up giving me a much bigger loss? 

Please see screen shot here example of my losses and profits and my pip value http://i.imgur.com/BfOfDz7.png
My losing trades appear to have a normal pip value or high pip value giving me a much bigger loss and the profitable trades usually have a much lower pip value giving me less profit on the winning trades. Am I being scammed, is this normal? 

Update

I just spoke to my broker and they said they figure pip value like this, if you're trading USDCAD the pip value of the lot size 0.10 is $1 Canadian dollars which is $0.782 So it's not based on US dollar value it's the Canadian dollar. But If I was trading EURUSD then 0.10 would equal $1 US per 0.10 lot size. Does this sound right?

I mean, this one is cut & dry.  782-784 is really strong resistance that I trust for at least another few rejections, plus a larger pullback is probably in store, as you can see if you check the daily (sorry, I'm lazy and don't feel like making a second chart rn).  You could cover in the low 77s (my plan) OR you could really throw a stop up there above 786 or so and hold out for the bigger pullback.  But that takes too long for me ;)

Edit: As of 4 hours before market close on Friday, A/U is just falling off of the map.  Might not see a retest for a while, and by that point I won't trust the level quite as much.  Although my gut says we won't be back for at *least* a week, but probably won't test again for a few weeks at minimum.  Oh well :/

Now, let’s take a look at some of the Australian economic indicators to get a better sense of whether we think the RBA will cut interest rates or leave them unchanged.

Overall Australia is doing fairly well. Their unemployment figures are declining on a monthly basis. GDP annual growth is improving. In January GDP came in at 3% while Oct 2015 the figure  was 2.7 and in July of 2015, it was only 2%.

On the other hand:

    Wage growth is slowing down on a monthly basis
    Retail Sales MoM is stagnant
    Retail Sales YoY is gradually declining
    Consumer Confidence declined in April to 95.1 from 99.1 in March and 101.3 in February
    New Home Sales dropped by 5.3% to 7332 in February from 7946 in January

I’m personally not in favor of trading prior to any major risk event like tomorrow’s FOMC but based on the fundamentals that I gathered here and analyzing the chart technically, I’m more bullish towards this particular pair and prefer to continue to trade with the trend.

1658,2016-04-28,USDJPY Justice served :),"When I saw the price of YEN soaring against the USD yesterday I had an interesting thought.

Justice was served.

As we all know Japan was hit by earthquakes and the first thing on a forex trader's mind would be to short their national currency because the economy will be affected negatively. To dump a currency of a country in crisis and actually making it worse for their economy it is totally inappropriate and wrong from an ethical standpoint.

From a trader perspective for an asset to move up or down in price it makes no difference because any direction creates equal opportunity to make money. So instead of shorting YEN the market could long YEN and actually help their economy in the midst of crisis.

BTW, I know that BOJ announced negative interest rates and that was the real reason for the move, but I threw this one out anyway just for something to think about.

Let me know what you guys think.",0,0.25

1660,2016-05-01,The Complete Guide to Becoming a Consistently Profitable Trader,"**Law of large number and how it impacts your trading**


Before anything else, you must understand the law of large number.


Wait, what’s that?


The law of large numbers is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed. – Probability Theory


For a trader, this means you need a large number of trades for your edge to play out.


You will not be consistently profitable every week, taking 5 trades a month.


Why?


Because according to the law of large number,  results are random in the short run, but will be closer to the expected value in the long run.


Since the law of large number requires a certain number of trades for your edge to play out,  how does it impact your trading?


&nbsp;


**What is consistency?**


Since the law of large number requires a certain number of trades for your edge to play out,  how does it impact your trading?


High-frequency trading – Trading at very high frequency, like 10,000 trades a month. You can expect to be profitable for most of the months, or even every day like Virtu Financial (But I wouldn't recommend this route if you're a retail trader as you need the right technology and deep pockets).


Day trader – Trading an average of 3 – 5 times a day, you can expect to be profitable in most of the quarters.


Swing/position trader – Trading an average of 5 – 15 times a month, you can expect to be profitable for most of the years.


The more trades you put on during a shorter period of time, the faster your edge will play out. 


But without an edge in the markets, the more trades you put on leads to blowing up your account even faster.


Understand this and you’re ahead of 90% of traders out there.


Next:


&nbsp;


**Find a trading style that suits you**


Not only that, it has to also fit your schedule. If you have a full-time job, it does not make sense to be a day trader.


Go read Market Wizards. It contains an interview with successful traders of various trading styles.


This way you’ll learn what works in the market, and pick one trading style that suits you.


Once you’ve decided on one, find out everything you can about it.  Let’s assume you want to be a trend follower.


You can look at:


Academic research papers – You can google academic research papers. E.g. Search for ‘trend following academic research papers’. These are useful research papers you can explore.


Books – Search for books relevant to your trading style. E.g. Search for ‘trend following’ on Amazon. Here’s a list of books that I would highly recommend.


YouTube – Watch videos and learn the thought process of other traders. E.g. Search for ‘trend following’ on YouTube.


Google – You can always find a hidden gem here. Like interviews, podcasts, and blogs related to trend following.


Social Media – You can connect with traders who are successful. Follow them on Twitter and Facebook etc.


Now:


Use all these information you have and build a trading plan.


Here’s how…

&nbsp;


**Develop your trading plan**


A trading plan is a structure or a set of guidelines, that defines your trading.


It removes subjectivity in your trading, minimizes the roller coaster emotions, and keeps you prepared at all times.


 So, how do you develop a trading plan?


Below are 7 essential questions that every trading plan must answer:


Time frame traded


You must know the time frame you are executing your trades.


For day traders, you would be trading lower time frames like 5 minutes. For swing/position trader, you would be trading higher time frames like 4 hours or daily.


Markets traded


You must know which markets you will be trading. Would you trade all markets, or just trade a certain sector?


Risk management


You must know how much risk you are putting on each trade, and how it will change as your trading capital increase/decrease over time. What % of your account will you risk on each trade?


What are the conditions of your trading setup?


You need to define what is the exact market condition required before you put on a trade.


When to enter


You need to define how exactly will you enter a trade.


When to exit if you are wrong


Whenever you enter a trade, you must know the point at which you are wrong, and get out. Which is the point on the chart that will prove your wrong?


When to exit if you are right


When the price goes in your favor, you must know how you will exit your trade. Would you trail your stops or set a profit target ahead of time? Would you look to take partial or full profit?


*Disclaimer: Below is a sample trading plan that I came up with randomly, please do your own due diligence.*


Sample trading plan


I like to use the IF THEN syntax in my trading plan. It helps keep me more objective with lesser room for discretion.


If I am trading, then I will only trade Eurusd and Audusd. (The markets you are trading)


If I place a trade, then I will not lose more than 1% of my account. (Your risk management)


If 100 EMA is above 200 EMA on daily, then the trend is bullish. (Conditions before entering a trade and time frame you are trading)


If the trend is bullish, then identify an area of support where the price can retrace to. (Conditions before entering a trade)


If price retrace to your area of support, then wait for a higher close. (Conditions before entering a trade)


If price closes higher, then enter long at next candle open. (Entry)


If you are long, then place your stop loss below the low of the candle, and take profit at swing high. (Exit when you’re wrong, and when you’re right)

&nbsp;


**Execute your trading plan**


Once you’ve completed your trading plan, forward test it in the live markets.


You can do it on demo or small live account.


I would suggest trading micro lots on a live account, to take into account how psychology affects your trading.


You have to execute your trades consistently according to your trading plan. This is where your discipline comes into play, only taking trading setups that meet your trading plan.


Warning 1: If you entering trades based on how you feel instead of following your trading plan, then it would be impossible to tell whether your trading plan has an edge in the markets.


Warning 2: Do not change your trading plan, or jump onto another trading system when you are having a series of losses. I know you are tempted to do so.


Recall the law of large number?


Results are random in the short run, but will be closer to the expected value in the long run.


This means if you change your trading plan after a few losing trades, you’d never know if you have an edge in the markets. And you will be running around in circles forever!


I would recommend having a sample size of at least 100 trades, before deciding whether your trading plan has an edge in the markets.


&nbsp;


**Record your trades to remain objective**


Executing your trades consistently isn’t enough. You must record down your trades to collect relevant statistical data.


Why?


So you can make an objective conclusion and know whether your trading plan has an edge in the markets.


You can easily do this on an excel spreadsheet with the relevant metrics below:


Date – Date when your trade is entered


Time Frame – The time frame you are entering on


Setup – The trading setup that triggers your entry


Product – Financial product that you trade E.g. Apple, Gold, Eur/Usd


Lots – Position size you entered


Long/short – Direction of your trade


Tick value – Value per pip. E.g. 1 standard lot of Eurusd is $10/pip


Price In – Price you enter your trade


Price Out – Price you exit, at profit or loss


Stop loss – Price where you will exit if your trade is wrong


Profit & loss – Profit or loss from this trade


Initial Risk in $ – Nominal risk value of this trade


R – Your initial risk of this trade. E.g If you made 2 times your initial risk, you made 2R.


Review your trades and find your edge


After you have a sample size of 100 trades, you can look to review your statistics to see whether you have an edge in the markets.


The most important trading equation you must know:


Expectancy = (Winning % * Average win) – (Losing % * Average loss) – (Commission + slippage)


If you have a positive expectancy, congratulations! You have an edge in the markets.


But what if you don’t have?


You can consider:


Increase your winning % – Be more selective with your entries. Look for other confluence factors that can be added to your trading plan.


Increase your average win – Ride your winners longer. You can do this by trailing your profits as price moves in your favor.


Decrease your average loss – Cut your losses. You can do this by cutting your losers quickly.


Note:


If you do not have an edge in the markets, increasing your frequency of trades will not make you profitable. It will only make you lose faster than before.


Likewise, reducing your risk per trade will still cause you to lose, but at a slower pace.


Once you’ve identified the issues and come up with a solution, repeat the entire process over again. Develop >> Execute >> Record >> Review

&nbsp;


I hope this will shed some light on what it takes to become a consistently profitable trader.

Don't hesitate to let me know if there's anything, I'll be glad to help.

1662,2016-05-01,Can someone explain to me why iML (imarketlive) is a scam?,"Now, I have already seen posts that said iML is a scam. But I guess, I'm in that state of self-deception and I want to believe that it's not. Right now, I have a foot invested in iML that cost me $1 to get access to everything except IBO. 

It been about 2 weeks now and, as a newbie, everything seems great and legit. Until I saw reddit's posts regarding iML. Since I don't want to be a fool, I'm posting this topic hoping that you guys can convinced my self-deception that this is truly a scam.

1st off, on the first training video, you can hear CEO terry saying that ""Results are not typical and past performance doesn't guarantee future results."" which immediately made me lower my ""bullshit"" guard and further believe that this is legit, because it sounds like a real life situation.  

I tried their autotrader aka fx signal live, (with demo of $5,000 USD) which I find it to be super slow in gain. Withing 2 weeks it went from initial to $5,121. Seems like crap to me, but at least it's bring in profit. So nothing that trigger my ""bullshit"" radar here since the rate feels realistic to me.

Now, the harmonic scanner seems to be working best for me, (again in demo money) I win some and I lose some, but ultimately, I win more than lose, so I was in the profit. Which again, seems realistic to me, since the harmonic scanner is not 100% accuracy.

So far, with the demo account and the harmonic scanner, I learn to control myself a bit more when I lose money, and I learn to be patient and learn to study the market (when to enter, exit, etc) 

based on my experience, I just honestly don't understand how iML can be a scam. But I'm just a new trader, so I'm probably wrong when compared to you guys.

Sorry for my ignorance, but I will really appreciate your input on this. For the time being, I will check out https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/wiki/index and try to learn more information.

P.S. please note that I am not an IBO so I don't have any experience with iML's MLM system. IMO, being an IBO seems like hard work just for $35. So I don't understand why would anyone want to be an IBO.

1686,2016-05-13,EUR/USD sentiment,"Figured I'd share with y'all my current thoughts on where EUR/USD is headed. 

I'm short in the short term, but long for the long term (heh).  I think the upper teens are too much for price to maintain, at least for now - no significant events have occurred, macro wise, for such a drastic change in range/equilibrium. At the same time, the Euro has fallen an awfully long way, and while my fundamentals are weak, I know things are starting to turn around, and I imagine the US is bound for a fade & Europe is going to see some re-ignited investment allure (as the refugee crisis fades and Brexit becomes less likely). 

I'd call this support at 1.137 temporary. I think as this bullish excitement fades, selling might come in as the market maintains it's current equilibrium at ~1.10. There's no reason for us to be willing to pay more than 1.14, at least for now. But as price falls, demand should come in somewhere above 1.10 - the summer is approaching fast and investors are likely to pay 1.10-1.12 if they're looking long term. We've seen extended demand at 1.135+, more than our last visit to these levels, showing more willingness in the market to pay higher prices for their Euros. As the terror and refugee crisis’(crisisese?) fade, investments in Europe will become more attractive. In addition, shorts from here may see the support as a chance to get out for a decent profit. 

If things continue to brighten for Europe, I expect demand to find the low teens an acceptable price for e/u. Technicals might inspire a feverish selloff as momentum dies this far north - but violent buying will show us where too low is *too* low. Buy the fuckin’ dip and get rich!

1703,2016-05-29,AUD/USD Short Opportunity?,"Hi Everyone,

I don't normally stray from USD/CAD at this point but I think its time to branch out some. This has mainly been due to me trying to get my system down by focusing on one pair initially. So to prepare for this coming week, I looked at a few more pairs. AUD/USD caught my eye but I would like to see what other think to make sure Im not missing something here specific to the pair. 

I am basically trading price/volume at this point looking for breakout candles on the hourly chart and using volume profile on the futures contracts of each currency in the pair.  Im also using Ichimoku and S/R lines for confirmations and to help me see trends a little better. Lastly, I am experimenting with Renko charts (25 and 100 tick) to see if they are actually useful or not. Im not basing trades off of this yet though. I also keep track of the Commitment of Traders numbers each week in a spreadsheet that puts it on a nice graph I came up with. Helps to see short vs long and open interest changes week to week from the commercial side.

[AUD/USD CHARTS](http://imgur.com/a/ftBJb)

So to the AUD/USD pair, It appears to me that we will see this pair continue to drop providing a good short swing or longer term trade opportunity. Looking at the weekly chart, There was a clear rejection of the rebound 4 weeks ago and it has been following the kumo cloud downwards ever since. Looking at the commitment of traders chart I put together on AUD, its clear that the commercial traders have been exiting their long positions but open interest is evening out and not dropping anymore. This signals to me that they are moving to short positions before driving the price down further. The renko chart also seems to be signaling a short entry here but I dont trust it enough to make a move based on it yet. 

Any input on this would be greatly appreciated.",8,0.83

1710,2016-06-04,Why do people say higher Account Leverage increases the risk of a Margin Call when it's actually the opposite ?,"I often see people saying high Account Leverage is more risky and I don't understand why.

Lets say you have an account with a balance of $250 and an account leverage of 400:1 (Margin% of 0.25). You want to risk no more than 1% per trade so that's $2.5 and a stop loss of 25 pips. With your 400:1 leverage only $2.5 will be set aside as a Used Margin when you buy one micro lot leaving you available Margin of $247.5 and if you forgot your stop loss the available margin will at 0 after 2475 pips moving against you(Euro Dollar). Now if your Account leverage was 50:1 it will take $20 as Used Margin to buy one Micro lot and that means it will take only 2300 pips to bring your available margin to 0. 

So it may not be by much but it seems like higher leverage actually decreases the risk of Margin Call or am I mistaken ?",1,0.57

Also, people seem to be overlooking the big elephant in the room, the June FOMC.

If you are a n00b, *stop trying to get rich off of the Brexit vote*.  You need to concentrate on successful, positive trades, not big wins.  Go gamble if you want that rush.  The Brexit vote is one of those events that can cause such precipitous damage to accounts that **Brokers are limiting retail leverage and raising margin rates:** (from Oanda)

> During events such as the upcoming Brexit referendum, market movements can be significant leading to the potential for large profits, but also large losses. To help ensure our customers are more insulated from such movements, **we will be temporarily lowering the maximum leverage available on GBP pairs to 20:1 after the market close on June 17, 2016**. The affected pairs will return to prior leverage levels after the market close on June 24, 2016.

To determine the impact this change may have to your margin, you can use OANDA’s margin calculator.

And FOMC? The June FOMC is not just any FOMC, it will really be a bellwether for 2016 for the Fed's direction with interest rates until election and Christmas.  Will they stick to their word and raise rates?  Or change course and have a flat rate, showing their weak hand?  There are estimates in both directions (some showing preciptious cliffs, some showing seismic movements back and forth), but again, unless you are confident in your analysis, market intel, and skill set, *pay attention because the June FOMC has a potential for a radical whipsaw*.

1732,2016-06-14,What I Learned From the Best Trader I Have Ever Known,"**What I Learned From the Best Trader I Have Ever Known**

I know many traders and I have worked with many traders around the world. However, one trader who is, by far, the best trader I have ever known. He is an unbelievable trader. He is very consistent and he makes an incredible amount of money trading every day. You may have heard of him, he has been interviewed in trading books, and he often speaks at trading groups and trading seminars. I will simply refer to him as my “Millionaire Trader Friend” and I will tell you what I have learned from him.

I still remember the day that I had come to realize just how successful my Millionaire Trader Friend was at trading. Today I must admit it does not seem as impressive as I have been able to see and meet successful traders from all around the world, but I do know that he is an impressive trader and I still hold him in high regard. I have been luck to know my Millionaire Trader Friend and I have reaped many benefits from incorporating the lessons I have learned from him into my own trading. It is my hope that you too will benefit from what he has taught me. 

**1. Do One Thing, and Do It Well**

If there is one simple thing that I have learned from my Millionaire Trader Friend, the best trader I have ever known, it is this – to make money trading you only have to become an expert at one type of trade. There is no need to run several different trading systems. You may simply concentrate on one trading system, and if you trade it well you can become a very successful trader.

You may not even need to concentrate on many different markets, you may find that simply concentrating on one currency pair is enough for you to find many profitable trade setups. This is what my friend does, he trades only the GBP/USD and he has success with this.

**2. You Can Have An Extremely High Win Rate**

There has been a lot written about win rates (what percentage of your trades are profitable trades), but what some traders do not seem to understand is that it is possible to have an exceptional win rate. 70%, 80%, even 90% is possible. This I have learned from my Millionaire Trader Friend – he has an incredibly high win rate, and I do too now because I have learned so much from him.

My Millionaire Trader Friend is continually improving as a trader. He is constantly figuring out ways to get better at what he does. He uses every loss as an educational experience – that is how he sees them. Every loss is a lesson that the market has handed him. I would not say that he embraces losing trades, but he does learn from them.

**3. Patience is Rewarded**

Another thing that I have learned from my Millionaire Trader Friend is that it pays to be patient. Profitable traders like my Millionaire Trader Friend wait for the perfect trade setup. Many traders who do not consistently make money trade for the sake of trading, I used to do this too. I used to look at the markets and ask myself “which way is the Pound going to go?” Now I look at the markets and say “Is there a trade I must take right now?” I have learned to be patient, and my trading account has grown accordingly.

**4. The Best Time for A Trade is When Everyone Else Disagrees**

If you think about it, it makes sense – the very best time to buy something is when everyone is convinced that the price is going to fall lower, and the very best time to sell something is when everyone is convinced the price is going to shoot to the moon. My Millionaire Trader Friend has taught me the importance of trading against the crowd. *The crowd is reacting to the market*, and my trading partner has taught me to *react to the crowd*. This simple change in mindset can produce incredible profits if you are willing to look like a fool (in the eyes of others).

**5. Being Wrong is Not a Bad Thing**

My Millionaire Trader Friend has taught me that even the best traders, like him, are sometimes caught on the wrong side of the market. There is no need to panic when this happens, but once it does a very good thing to do is to simply get out. Once you realize that your trade was not a good idea, there is no need to wait for your stoploss to get hit, when you know you have made the wrong move you can simply get out of the market and wait for the next trade.

This is what I have learned from my Millionaire Trader Friend – if you are absolutely certain that you made the wrong move, sometimes the best thing to do is to exit the market and then place a trade in the opposite direction. This can be extremely difficult to do, particularly if you have put a lot of time and effort into analyzing the trade.

**6. Let the Trades Come To You**

If there is one thing I have noticed about how my Millionaire Trader Friend trades (and this is not a unique characteristic, many of the very best traders I have ever traded with also have this characteristic) it is this he does not go looking for trades, he waits for them to jump out at him. This may seem like a weird way to trade, but it is precisely how he takes so many profitable trades. He waits and watches, and when the market gives him an opportunity to jump in to a good situation he enters the trade. He never trades simply because the market is open, and he sometimes sits in front of his charts for hours and never trades. I have learned from him that successful trading means being ready for the market to offer you “free money” – or ideal trading setups. When these setups come along I know it because I feel like I must take advantage of the opportunity the market is offering.

**7. Create Your Own Trading Style**

How many times have you heard some expert trader say something like “Fibonacci doesn’t work!” or “never trade during a news release” or “scalping is impossible in forex.” One thing I have learned from my trading partner (and from working with traders all over the world) is that the very best traders create their own trading style. This doesn’t mean that you must re-invent the wheel to become a successful trader, it simply means that many successful traders have found their way to success by adapting trading strategies and making them their own. It is not important that you trade precisely as other successful traders do, but it is important that your style of trading makes sense to you, because this will ensure that you stick with the trading strategy over the long haul.

My Millionaire Trader Friend has a completely unique trading strategy that he has created over time, by exposing himself to many different ideas and many different traders. His system is unique because it is his, and it makes sense to him. This is important because it means that he is better able to maintain confidence through the drawdowns that will inevitably occur.

**8. Keep Learning**

My Millionaire Trader Friend has such a high win rate, and is so good at picking high probability trade setups that some people may assume that he knows that he has the markets “figured out.” Not so, he is constantly learning, he has many trading books, trading magazines and we are constantly talking about trading strategies. He learns from some of the best institutions and research centers around the world because he has a constant thirst for knowledge. The fact that he is open to new ideas and the fact that he is an exceptional trader is probably not a coincidence. I think that many successful traders are open to new ideas. This doesn’t mean that successful traders switch trading strategies every month (my Millionaire Trader Friend has been trading the same trading strategy for years), it simply means that many successful traders are open to new ideas and new ways of profiting from the markets.

**9. Everyone Has a Bad Streak**

Even my Millionaire Trader Friend will have the occasional unlucky streak with several losses in a row. This is not that interesting to me, but what is interesting to me is the way that he deals with these unlucky streaks. He does not lose confidence, he continues to take the next trade setups, as they occur, and he does not question his trading strategy. He knows that anyone can flip a coin and get “tails” 4 times in a row, and that is precisely how he views an unlucky streak. He knows that in the long run he will make up the lost money and then some, so there is no need to panic.

I hope that you have learned something from my Millionaire Trader Friend, I know I have.

1736,2016-06-17,The only 3 things you need to know if you'll make money in Forex,"Trading is based on probabilities and expected outcomes. For any system of trading you have you need to know exactly 3 things to know if you'll make money trading your system or not:

**1.  Win rate**

What is your % win rate?  As an example, when you go to the casino and play craps or blackjack your winrate is a mathematical given of less than 50%.  That's called the house edge.  Now you can still be successful if you have less than a 50% edge (0.5) but only if you also know the next thing:

**2. Risk to Reward ratio**

For every dollar you are risking on your trades how much are you going to get back when you win?  If you're playing blackjack it's almost always a 1:1 R:R ratio, that is if you bet $10 you'll usually only win $10.  

Now determine your net expectancy. Assume you're an above average blackjack player with a win rate of 49% or 0.49

I have a 0.49 chance on each hand of winning $10, so 0.49x10= +4.90

I have a 0.51 chance on each hand of losing $10, so 0.51x-10 = -5.10

Add those two together (+4.90 and -5.10) and I have a negative net expectancy of -.20 which means over time I can expect to go broke.

*To be successful at trading forex you must have a positive net expectancy. This cannot be overstated*

**3. Frequency**  Assuming you have a positive net expectancy, how often can you trade?  The more often you can trade your winning system the faster you'll get rich. All else being equal if you can trade your system on the hourly and make 12 trades a day versus 1 time a day on the daily you'll get rich 12 times faster. 

In the casino they're quite happy to let you play many hands rapidly, or even multiple slot machines because you're just bankrupting yourself faster.  In other words, no matter the game you choose the casino always has a positive net expectancy*. And the more players they can get playing rapidly the more money they'll make.

Be the casino, friends.

1746,2016-06-30,"How I use Volatility to my advantage (UK US open, late US etc)","**[Only applies to M30 and lower]**


**What is volatility?**

Volatility is the degree of variation in price of a given asset on a defined timeframe. When price moves quickly, market volatility increases. When price consolidates, market volatility decreases (simple definition). It is like the speedometer in our cars.

I usually add an Average True Range (ATR) on my charts to gauge approximately market volatility or market nervousness. However, it is not necessary, when you look at a chart you are able to tell if price is spiking, trending or consolidating.

Volatility is part of any strategy. It gives an expectancy toward future price action. In general, when market volatility is low, we expect significant support and resistance levels to hold price in a range. And when market volatility is high, we expect price to break these levels. 

**Volatility patterns**

Fortunately, in the Forex market, daily volatility is predictable. We tend to see volatility peaks around major markets openings, which are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Japanese Exchange. At the late hours of these markets, volatility tends to decrease. 

These fundamental patterns are the most exploitable patterns in the Forex market. Yes, at least more exploitable than deceitful technical signals you are looking for. And they happen almost every day. However, there are exceptions. For example, we do not expect volatility peak to happen when countries of these big markets are on bank holiday.

[EURUSD hourly volatility](http://i.imgur.com/HMYzyWU.png)

The chart above shows the 4-weeks hourly volatility  for the EUR/USD pair. It is the average in pip of the difference between the highest and the lowest price of each hour of the day, over four weeks. Each bar represents the average in hourly range over four weeks.

There are two major peaks corresponding to the LSE and the NYSE openings. 

Since the EUR/USD is the most traded pair, we consider its volatility as ""market volatility"". In fact, the hourly volatility chart of the other pairs gives approximately the same pattern.

[USDCAD hourly volatility](http://i.imgur.com/NgxTV6C.png)

These charts were taken in May 2016. Take a look at Mataf.net’s volatility tool and type four (for four weeks) in the entry box. You will see approximately this same pattern in hourly volatility, with the two major peaks (UK and US opens) and decreasing volatility starting from the mid-US session. **(Currently the pattern is disturbed by the brexit monster volatility, it will become clear again within few weeks)**

We also have decreased volatility during the Asian session when there is no major news release coming from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) or the Bank Of Japan (BOJ).

[Asian sessions](http://i.imgur.com/66dQO01.png)

These charts tell us market volatility is predictable. This leads us to define two principles:

**First Principle**: Around major markets openings (active time), market volatility tends to surge. We expect to see range breakouts, spikes or rallies. It is the best time to trade breakouts i.e., buying new highs and selling new lows.

**Second Principle**: During the late hours of major markets sessions and when major markets are closed (quiet time), market volatility tends to decrease considerably. We expect to see trading range or congestion in price action. It is the best time to range-trade i.e., buying the lows and selling the highs. 

[principles](http://i.imgur.com/T7j8W11.png)

Any trading strategy or system has to adapt to these variations in volatility to perform over time. If you are struggling with a particular strategy, maybe you are ignoring these changes in volatility. 

**How volatility patterns can help in improving your trading?**

One cannot apply a strategy any time and expect to be profitable. When we simulate an automated and intraday trading system over three months without time filtering, we will notice the system is only profitable at certain hours of the day. This simply reflects intraday volatility variations.

You have to determine if your trading strategy is a trend following method or a range trading one.

If your strategy is a trend following approach, you will want to only trade around major markets openings to maximize profits. Otherwise, you will tend to give back profits as price slows down in the mid-session and market volatility decrease.

If your strategy is a range trading or reversal approach, you will want to only trade during quiet market time and avoid trading around market openings or around news releases. 

Less trades maximize profits. Most of my trading sessions last less than one hour.

I made a [portable document](http://priceactionpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Forex-Volatility-Patterns.pdf) of this.

1755,2016-07-06,Calculating exposure - am I doing it wrong?,"I have a very low-balance account ($100) with fxTrade on Oanda that I've been using to learn about Forex trading, try out crazy strategies, etc., whenever I don't have other work to do.

I've been trying to come up with a way to calculate my exposure on certain currencies, [like how Oanda shows it](http://i.imgur.com/Tt698hD.png), but I keep getting different numbers from what fxTrade reports.

My current algorithm is that first I put the desired currency instruments in a list. Then I fetch the current prices for the instruments in that list. Then, if the desired currency, say AUD, is on the left-hand side of the pair, and is a buy order, I add to a rolling sum the number of units in that currency I have; negative if it's a sell. If the currency of interest is on the right-hand side, for a buy order, I multiply the units currently held by the current price (fetched earlier) and subtract from the rolling sum; add if it's a sell order.

The output ends up [looking like this](https://i.imgur.com/rXPl0o2.png), and [here's my trade log, filtered by AUD](https://i.imgur.com/Qpi4pcB.png), so you can see how it compares (note that the current prices in the screenshot will be slightly different than my program snapshot, since I didn't get them at the exact same time).

As you can see, my program outputs an exposure of short 6.19815, but [Oanda's exposure tab reports short 7](https://i.imgur.com/QIEkK29.png) -- so it's close, but not quite right. At first I had thought it might be some sort of rounding issue (maybe it's doing floor on -6-point-something and getting -7), but for a more dramatic example, for TRY, [my program reports long 2.61587](https://i.imgur.com/1XCqZwb.png), but [Oanda reports long 1](https://i.imgur.com/gHCFguy.png) -- not within rounding error -- for [these trades](https://i.imgur.com/v4MfR9r.png).

Missed trades: Selling USD/JPY correction rally at 50%-61.8% Fibonacci retracement level resistance.  102.80-103.40 area 

Buying NZD/USD correction dip at 61.8% retracement level support .7080

1765,2016-07-15,GBP/JPY and USD/JPY tonights Japan session (Discussion),"Ive been trading these pairs all week and I love them.  That being said today we had an unexpected interest rate decision   and it seems to have thrown everyone off on the pairs, the rest of the day price barely moved just trending sideways.

I want to have a discussion on everyones thoughts going forward it could go either way at this point im happy with either way it goes (as long as it commits). 

GBP/JPY: My personal opinion and what may be possible is tonights Japan session may continue to drop the yen and surge prices up for the GBP/JPY especially with the news this morning.  My TA is telling me it will continue pushing higher and im willing to continue long on the pair but at the sametime there are quite a lot of traders thinking that the GBP should push to lower lows so if it did reverse it could reverse fast....very fast.  Overall I think a buy, its a personal favourite pair of mine for the fact that it just has absolutely EPIC moves and makes me quite alot of profit. 

USD/JPY: So ive personally been expecting a large hike in prices since before Brexit it was Oversold just before Brexit and the Brexit pretty much destroyed it temporarily (hopefully). The large moves of the week from a TA perspective have been forecast for a while. Even last week I lost a few trades to it expecting a spike higher. Currently nothing much is holding it back on Fundis that ive seen as far as this week.  Personally I think the pair can hit as high as 109 which isnt to far from where it is now.  Still looking long for the USD/JPY.

Id like to hear everyones forecast for the pairs and what side theyre on.",2,0.76

1789,2016-07-29,Question on a Fundamental Concept regarding Forex Trading,"Hi ! Let's say I have 100$ to trade (no leverage involved). I have 2 pairs to trade (2 cases to discuss) : **USD/CAD & EUR/USD**.

**First case - USD/CAD** - quote : 1,32

I have 100 units to trade because the base currency (USD) is the same as my account currency , right?

**SELL**

Having 100$ means for this pair that I have 100 units to trade (correct me if I am wrong). What am I really selling? (I am selling 100 units of what?). As far as I know, I convert my units (am I really converting units??) in CAD, then wait for this pair to go down (USD down, CAD up). Suppose it goes to 1,31. Then I convert them back to USD gaining more money.

Another important question : how can I sell when I didn't buy anything before ? 

**BUY**

What am I buying? I also have 100 units to trade , but what exactly am I buying? And who buys from me and what does he/she buy? I convert my units to what , and the convert them back to what? 

I know that when I **BUY**, I buy USD and sell CAD at the same time (but how is it happening?). When I **SELL**, I sell USD and buy CAD at the same time. The one who is buying/selling from me, what does he/she buy/sell? 


**Second case - EUR/USD** - quote : 1,1234

Here the base currency is different from my account currency, so I'll have (1 / 1,1234) * 100 = (approximately) 89 units to trade.

Same questions here : what am I buying and what am I selling ? Do the units convert when I buy or sell ? Am I really trading units, or buying EUR and selling USD at the same time when buying this pair for example? What are the differences here ? 

Please be patient because there are a lot of questions and some of them might be a little stupid.

I'm kinda new to forex and want to get a grasp why the markets behaved in a certain way in the past. Looking at a EUR/USD chart I realized that from may 2015 to march 2016 the value of the euro compared to usd depreciated from 1.4 to roughly 1.04 . Why did this happen? Was it because the ECB started quantitative easing?

How do other major players in the world market see the outcome?

Will this effect other Currencies? (I Expect CAD to be effected)

1822,2016-08-29,"Lessons of wrong monetary semantics from Jackson Hole Meeting by Emanuele Canegrati, Market Analyst at BlackPearlFX","Financial markets are more and more dependent on the Fed. And this is not a good news for investors, because it means that the decisional monopoly power of the FOMC is getting stronger and stronger. It is interesting to observe how FOMC meetings are now studied well before their dates. You hardly can remember of a Jackson Hole meeting so much awaited as than one of this year. The media coverage of the event was worthy of major world political events; televisions, social networks, newspapers: no one has missed the appointment.
The wait was all for the declaration of Fed's chairwoman Janet Yellen on the much anticipated rise in US interest rates. Will the hike take place during the next FOMC in September? Or do we have to wait until the last FOMC of this year? These were the open questions. At the end, Janet Yellen simply said everything and nothing (""gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over time to achieve and sustain employment and inflation near our statutory objectives.”), in deference to the new Fed communications course, better known as ""forward guidance"". Which is, in Hayek's words, a semantic trap, since the Fed is not guiding financial markets at all, as it is not clear where the central banks aims to arrive, and a dangerous contraddiction in terms, as a guide must have a clear language and not obscure as the Fed has. 
Yellen has hinted that a rate hike will take place almost certainly by the end of the year, but refused to give more precise indications as to which FOMC meeting will take this decision. And so, immediately after the speech, the most varied interpretations have been circulated among experts, economists and scholars of the semantics of the most cryptic central bank in the world. Finanancial investors seem not to have believed the interpretation of an immediate increase in interest rates, so that the stock indices reacted positively and the dollar weakened. Bond traders seem to have believe in the 2016 hike, as benchmark two-year Treasury yields, the coupon maturity traditionally most sensitive to Fed expectations, reached the highest since June and yield curve flattened.

Neither Fed's officials agree as to the timing of the hike. Fed's Fischer said Yellen speech is 'consistent' with rate hike as soon as September while the Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester on CNBC declared that she sees gradual path of rate rises. Fed’s Kaplan says the ancitipated path of interest rate increases going forward ""will be much flatter"".
So what can we take from Jackson Hole meeting? First of all, that monetary policy is gradually becoming a matter of a cryptic semantics. The ""do not say"" but ""let intuit"". Who benefits from this lack of transparency communicational? Because the Fed believes represent the relationship between institutions and the financial markets as a game is good? The answer is in the willingness of the central bank to strengthen its power and the dependence of the market by its decisions. Power, after all, is more in the ""do not tell"" rather than the ""make it clear."" And this is a law that the monetary bureaucrats seem to have learned very well. Secondly, zero interest rate policy is coming to and end, with great relief in the banking and pension sectors, those who have lost more from the zero-rate policy: the first for the collapse in profitability, the second for the value loss of savings accumulated over time. If the hike will hit emerging markets and currencies, make explode the bubble on equity markets and on some commodities (gold and silver are serious candidates for this) only time can tell us.",0,0.5

Hello everyone, 
I hope you all had a fine weekend. This is my setup for the week of 9/25/16 on the GBPUSD pair. 

Two things that I am looking for on this setup are: 
1. Hidden divergence within RSI compared to the price chart.
2. Support level at Brexit lows. 

These two factors have contributed to my inkling that the pair may have a chance for a massive breakout of potentially 100-200 pips. I have set two take profit levels in the event that two likely scenarios take place. 

At take profit level #1, I will be looking for the price to breakthrough this level and test it as a new support zone, and I will also be looking for the price to hit this level and try to reverse off it. If the latter takes place, I plan to close my position as I suspect there will be a bit of ranging going on, and in the event of the former, I will be looking to add onto my position to hopefully try to hit my take profit level #2. I suspect there will be a large rejection of the TP #2 level as that is a hard resistance zone.

Because of Japan's large amount of trade with the United States, Asia, Europe and other countries, multinational corporations have a regular need to convert local currency into yen and vice versa. Consistently low interest rates in Japan have made the yen a popular currency for the carry trade as well.

If I had just waited I could at least close it with minimal loss or even profit.

2. Downward Trendline (Cyan) shows falling price trend prevalent.

3. Lack of strong support, but very weak daily ""support"" at approx. .7225 ready to be pushed down through.

4. MACD shows a negative histogram and falling MAs indicating downward pressures and further evidence of the end of any uptrend.

This is a wierd way to look at a GBPJPY trade by looking at the USDJPY but I hope this makes sense.
If price hits the green box the GBPJPY should push way higher possibly to 140.  My logic behind this is if USDJPY keeps  pushing higher and higher it will weaken the JPY tremendously allowing the GBPJPY (now 131.5-132) to push alot higher atleast to 138 possibly to 140.  The USD has been getting stronger constantly, today the jobless claims were unexpectedly low at 249k which I would think hand in hand should go with unemployment rate and the non farm payroll tomorrow.  If these are good tomorrow we should see the USDJPY shoot up allot which makes the GBPJPY go up due to the JPY weakness, also the GBP has news tomorrow which I do not know much about so if that's good then we are golden.

1894,2016-10-09,A lesson for all traders,"If you guys take a look at the weekly trades post for last week, I posted my trades there. The first thing I posted was that I was heavily long GBP.. everyone knows how that turned out lol. I was also wrong on my USD/CAD shorts as well as my EUR/GBP shorts. I was wrong in almost all of my trades in a week with a flash crash on the currency I was most heavily long. 

The lesson here is this....the losses were within my risk tolerance and I still have positive returns for this funding period because I use good MONEY MANAGEMENT and STOP LOSSES (the stop losses saved my ass on the flash crash..exactly what they are supposed to do). 2-3 years ago when I first started trading, a week like this would have demolished my account. Losses would have been 30-60% of my account

I wanted to post this because this is the difference between staying profitable and blowing an account real quick. Had these trades went in my favor my gains would have been smaller because of my money management, however you need to understand that trading is a marathon, not a 100m sprint.

For example, US had a strong jobs report last week so the USD should have appreciated, but lets say the jobs report was extremely good and the level of US unemployment lowered to 2%.

""Volatility in euro markets rose last week on media reports, that the ECB may be discussing tapering its asset purchase program, scheduled to end in March 2017. However, such speculation was quickly denied by Vice President Vitor Constancio. The ECB's communication this week, including speeches by ECB's Mersch (Tuesday, Wednesday) and Coeure (Wednesday) will likely also attempt to curb speculation of premature tapering. **A unified message regarding the ECBs ability to continue easing should keep EURUSD in check, in our view. We continue to envision EURUSD at 1.08 by year-end**
The accounts of the GC meeting released last week offer some comfort to our view that the ECB will announce changes to the technical parameters and an extension of QE beyond March 2017, at its December meeting (see ECB minutes: Monetary support still warranted, 6 October 2016). At this stage, we think changes to the size or composition of the PSPP are unlikely before March 2017 and in any case with related communication that reassures markets that policy will remain accommodative for the foreseeable future.

**In other words, the ECB faces a communications challenge that will be crucial for the future path of the EUR and euro area rates. The challenge is essentially to succeed where the Fed did not during the Taper Tantrum, by convincing markets that a slower pace of balance sheet expansion is still stimulatory.""**",9,0.85

1917,2016-10-16,Need help on deciding my forex account’s base currency,"Hey I’m a 21M from Australia and I have 5k-10k AUD, 5K USD, 2k GBP and 6-7k EUR that I’m looking to start out with (I’ve been traveling and never converted my money back). I’ve been trading forex on a demo account for a few months and I’m ready to create a live account. I have a multi-currency bank account with my local bank so it would be possible to deposit/withdraw with it and wouldn’t need to instantly convert it at withdraw.

I have a job in Australia and earn 5-6k AUD p/m so I don’t need the profits from forex and would probably use it to buy stocks (NASDAQ and NYSE so would need USD). Since I have quite a few currencies to fund my live account with, I was just wondering which one would be more beneficial to use in my situation and why.

Here is what I’m roughly thinking. AUD has been dropping and has been dropping for the last 3-4 years due to mining industry being shut down (mining is/was the main income of Australia). So I feel AUD is likely going to keep falling. Plus, Australia has very little going for it in terms of economy.

Brexit has killed GBP. GBP is being under siege by the EU leaders by trying to make it as difficult for Britain as possible with the trade rules and taxes. And it seems like people would need to have a British Passport to stay in Britain and work in Britain so millions of working professionals will be forced out of the country. So it seems like a lot of Britain based businesses would be hurt because of it.
Since USD is considered to be the global currency and their economy seems to continuously bounce back after the collapse of the housing market, 911, etc. It seems to me that USD may be the safest currency to fund my forex account with since its unlikely to lose much of its value over a long period of time.

Europe is in a pretty crappy situation with their ‘open boarders’ being flooded by illegal refugees. I don’t know much about Europe’s politics and incomes etc. (which is a shame because I’m from Europe) but from what little I know, the big economy leaders in Europe are Germany, France and Britain Netherlands, Sweden etc. And now due to Britain exiting the EU it seems like Europe is going to be left with a lot of poorer countries with poor economy. So this whole Brexit and migrant crisis is a big turn off for me from Europe and the Euro in general.

**TL**;**DR**: From Australia, have AUD, USD, GBP and EUR left from travel/work and ready to fund my forex account. Not sure if I’m going to stay in Australia, but not sure where I’d move. Which currency would hold its value strongest over time. And which base currency should I use?

1934,2016-10-24,About Fed's Oct 20 13:45 meeting,"hi there,
this is my first on reddit so excuse me if i don't comply to some rules...
i recently started trading with real money after a couple of months of trading the news on a demo account. as i intended to start experimenting with 1500 euros, i set my demo account on Plus500 to 2000 euros and started trading only big news events and had relatively good results (around 35% profit in 2 months, which isn't huge but was higher than my goal)
after switching to real money, i applied my strategy and got around 30% profits in a week and started to get confident. this led to opening trades without stop losses occasionally. 
finally during the draghi speech as i noticed the speculated tapering move wasn't going to take place and there were absolutely no signs of a move that would increase the euro strength i placed a risky short order (around 1/3 of my capital) without any limits. i was expecting that even if EUR/USD got higher it would eventually go down. which it did but after a MASSIVE and very short-lived spike in the upside that absolutely crushed all my capital. 

i know this is a newbie mistake and i had it coming as i didnt place a stop loss and i moved away from my strategy (basically i told myself i'd never place orders during the press conferences as big market movers tend to reach the news before individuals and move the instrument significantly), but i want to really learn about why this sudden spike to the upside then a sudden reversal happened? 

good luck to all in q4 :)",1,0.57

The AUDJPY long is down from a high of $97,000 to $52,000 now. Both trades have gone against me due to risk aversion with the election coming up.
My base case scenario for Trump being elected in the short term is risk aversion CHF, JPY, EUR getting stronger/stocks fall, but in the medium term it'd be risk positive, so USD, AUD, NZD, (possibly GBP) long, but price would need to find a new balance first. If it happened I'd likely take a EUR/NZD long in the short term, and then try to find AUDJPY/USDCHF longs later.
My base case scenario for Clinton being elected would be risk positive, so USD, AUD, NZD, (possibly GBP) long, immediately. If it happened I'd likely hold my AUDJPY long, and re-enter USDCHF if Clinton takes an early lead in Florida.

As far as stoplosses, and target prices, I'd be looking to put the stop at the low or high of the day depending on what direction I'm looking for. I wouldn't have a TP, but I would play out the EUR/NZD long on the 4 hour or daily chart, and the AUDJPY - USDCHF longs on the daily or weekly chart

If we see trump getting in I believe that the value of the dollar will decrease due to the volitile nature of the man, but having said this he is a business man and the markets might believe that he will do anything in his power to strengthen it.

I'm going to play ranges until there's a more clear understanding of what's in store for President Trump. 

Part of me thinks that no matter how extreme is rhetoric was during campaigning, he will moderate substantially due to natural political cycle (making promises you don't intend to keep during campaigning).

1995,2016-11-16,EUR/USD - Where do you see it going the next two weeks? First time poster.,"After the election the euro has weakened vs. the dollar. It's currently testing $ 1.07

The probability of a rate hike as spiked to 94% as I write, and inflation expectations from budget deficits under Trump has spiked. This has caused the dollar to strengthen as rates have increased. Using CIP we can construct the forward rate as 1.07 * (1 / 1.025) where euro rates are 0, and us rates at 2.5% we can make a forecast for the pair to be at somewhere between 1.05 at year end. The increase in rates in the denominator may have caused the recent fall in the currency pair.

From a technical perspective, I see the EUR/USD pair as a near stationary process, with a rolling mean that is nearly flat. At 1.07 $ it is testing the -2 standard deviation resistance band, looking at 1 day bars at a 1 yr period. I also see the dollar as overbought. I am long the euro, waiting for a mean reverting process. To cover at 1.11. When? Hard to say.

Possible issues with this trade: OPEC has a meeting on NOV 30th where a new production cap could cause oil to rally to $55. I think this trade would be finish by then, but speculators may cause oil prices to rise in anticipation for this event. I don't think that a OPEC agreement would meaningfully change the direction of USDCAD, which is why I am considering still taking this trade, but I'm undecided. 

AUD: I want to be bullish AUD, but the market currently disagrees with me. I'm waiting for the AUD index to find a bottom before considering longs

NZD: Seems to be more supported than AUD, but I am wary of longs due to NZD, and AUD being correlated. With AUD taking a dive last week, I am wondering if NZD may do the same. Investment banks seem to be neutral to bearish on NZD, price action has it lightly bullish

CAD: Investment banks seem to be fundamentally bearish on CAD due to Trump's stance on NAFTA, and other economic reasons, but the pending OPEC meeting has me wary on taking USDCAD higher. CAD has had a ranging price action on the index. 

EUR: I honestly don't know what to think about EUR, I want to be bearish on it. Investment banks are bearish EURUSD, but it seems to be more from the USD side, price action on the EUR index shows it's at the bottom of a range, but still in a range. There are quite a few political risks coming up on the 20th, and 27th

CHF: I want to be bearish CHF, but index price action shows it in a range, I want to be bearish due to the SNB's intervention, I think they are intervening at EURCHF 1.07, but I'm not confident enough in their ability to take a meaningful trade

JPY: I'm super bearish JPY, but this drop has gone on a while and I am not sure where to enter. 

USD: I'm super bullish USD, but this rise has gone on a while and I am not sure where to enter.

A USDCAD pull back into 1.32 would cause me to enter long SL 1.29 TP 1.37

A USDJPY pull back into 107 would cause me to enter long SL 104 TP 115

A AUDNZD pull back into 1.065 would cause me to enter short SL 108 TP 104

**Things I will be paying attention to this week:**

- USDCAD pull backs after oil rallies in anticipation for OPEC meeting on the 30th

- USDJPY pull backs

- AUD index finding a bottom after being heavily bearish

- EUR index holding or breaking range to the bottom

- NZD index breaking to the downside

- USD index to see if USD holds bullish momentum

First of all sorry for my weak english. I am reading the equity millipede pdf by Pipeasy and encountered with his first recommendation for entries.

Here is his strategy:

Enter every round number with sell or buy stop orders if the price coming down from the above .00 or the price straight coming up from the below .00 level. You should place two buy/sell stop order. The firs has 100 pip SL and 100 pip TP the second also have 100 pip SL but it has no TP. You let it run, this is your ""free leg"".

The idea is quiet interesting because in a good trend you can catch nice movements and stacking your positions in the same time. 

Take for instance have look for the recent usd pairs movements. You can easily find 500-1000 pip moves without any pullback.

I have just wondering is there any backtest out there because I would like to give it try sooner or later. I am well aware of the possible drawdowns but it would be casue smaller loss than a crazy emotional driven trading day.

What do you think guys, can such a strategy work in the long run?

2028,2016-12-02,Beware of 'robots' & 'expert advisors' - a post for noobs,"I was a noob once and I wanted to make money just like you but here is the thing... Maybe you don't currently have the knowledge or the resources to make sound decisions with regards to forex algos at the moment, so here is a post I would have loved to read a few years ago...

I'm a senior software developer with studies in robotics, geomatics and computer science and I have been testing software for the forex market for the past 2 years and I want to share with you some results.

First I have downloaded and tested an archive of about 100 commercial expert advisors for Metatrader4. Those EA are the kind you see on those make a million dollar in a month for only $499 web sites, with a picture of a young women on a yatch in the bahamas with 100 dollar bills flying around in the wind.. you know the kind. The results: *not a single one of them worked* and no wonder, all of their web sites are now parked domains ;)

Then I downloaded and tested the following EAs http://forexbad.com/fx-downloads/ (ie; the same kind). The results: *none of them worked*

Then I live tested many of the very few EA that seemed decent enough to be worth checking on MQL4.com market place. The results: *only one of them seems to be somewhat working but I still need time to be sure*. The MQL4.com marketplace is more or less a scam site; there are no refunds and nothing works. But if you are going to buy from that marketplace, my advice would be this; if there is no 'rent for 1 month' option for the EA and/or there is no 'real money live account signal' of the EA, just don't buy it, I guarantee you it's not going to work.

The bottom line is this; martingales, strategies that work only under impossible market condition or impossible spreads, holy grails & curve fitting, inevitable account blow up, you name it. As far as 'robots' and 'expert advisors' are concerned, the motto if it's too good to be true, it probably is has never been so true.

It's not because it works in the 'strategy tester' that it really works. It's not because it works on a demo live account, that it really works. In fact, it's not even because it works on a real live account signal from the author, that it really works... ( Here, read this if you must https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1413 )

The fact is this; 99.999999999999999% of 'robots' are scams written by scammers.

Even in the domain of the 'popular strategies' and 'popular technical analysis' department, just because a lot of 'forex blogs' and 'forex books' says that a moving average crossover is a good strategy, it does not make it so. In fact, when you account indicator lag and total lack of perspective of most technical analysis oriented strategists, you end up with a very different perspective on things. 

The sad reality is that almost all blogs are filled with ads with which the authors make money using organic traffic when in fact, if you look a little bit closer are the content, it's pure BS even total nonsense sometimes. As far as books are concerned, well, it's not because it's a book that it's any different... Even if it has the words 'bestseller' and 'recommended by top hedge funds' or if it's written by a PhD, does not make it's content automatically true. C'mon, don't be easily impressed.

Don't think the quant department is much better... It's all fun and games when you are learning statistics but when real money is in stakes, the room becomes really quiet... ;)

Here is a very good blog that debunks many of these so called strategy in an empirical way http://www.oxfordstrat.com/rd-blog/

*A lot* of people make 5 trades and come to the conclusion that their strategy works and that they will become rich... yeah, I guess we have all been there, but you know what I have come to realize? For those who don't see the bigger picture, ""On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.""...

So here, I hope you don't loose your money buying those 'get rich fast' schemes...

There is no free lunch.

This week I've been trying to master support / resistance levels for my trades. All was going well, few wins, few losses, up 3% on my account in one day, everything was going well. Time to move on from microlots to 2% of account value sized lots, great!

Then the ECB hit. RIP Money.

In the Asian session so the ECB hit while I was asleep, didn't even know what happened till I woke up down 10% of my account. Every single trade got stopped out.

My frustrations are both with my own lack of planning and i tend to find the Asian session to be... to be frank, quite boring.

There is a bit of movement around the majors, but from what I've seen it just tends to be consolidation patterns on the H1 or higher before the big moves occur during the later sessions, which are difficult to trade due to timezones.

And with only 3 pairs (AUDNZD, AUDJPY, NZDJPY) of significance which aren't dictated by the EUR/USD, limiting exposure to events outside of the timezone becomes difficult.

I can't help but think being inside the larger sessions, which both open closer together, overlap, and have individually have much larger volume is a big advantage for traders in those zones.

How have other traders in the Asian session found this? and what do you do to prevent exposure to unmanageable trades since all the majors are mostly effected by news while your catching flies?",4,0.75

2074,2016-12-15,My strategy works and i dont know why,"I will be sharing it. Use it or not.

It involves 2 accounts, one for trading small and recognizing patterns and one for trading bigger lots


I usually only trade the main pairs but i assume this works for any.

I start by setting a trade in the direction of the Pairs movement looking at the D1 timeframe.

If the pair has been going down for the last year i sell for .01

I do not set a stop loss.

usually the pair patternizes to a central price. For example i will be profiting 1.00 dollar and then it drops to -2.35 then back to 1.00.

I know that the next time it hits -2.35 i will set a trade in the direction opposite of my original trade on the second account. Only bigger. Sometimes standard lots sometimes less with a stop loss.

Ive been doing this for 6 months and manage a stable 2k/month.

i started with 1,000 dollars.

I use Oanda for my microtrades and Tradersway for my bigger trades.

Please review this strategy and tell me why i should stop using it.

It doesnt seem like it will work in the long run.

But this is the main technique i use for everyday trading,

Edit: sorry guys at work. Will respond when i have more time.

Edit 2: There has also been some speculation as why i just dont use a demo account to determine patterns. No clue maybe its just because a real account for both makes it more ""real?"" in a sense. It just doesnt feel the same honestly.",35,0.91

- Expecting a healthy pullback in dollar (TVC:DXY) testing some of the lower levels established after FOMC (low 102s) and possibly the high from before FOMC at 102.05

2132,2016-12-30,position size calculation with stop loss and risk + disagreement with MT4,"Hi Folks, I want to calculate my position size based off:

&nbsp;

total assets, 
risk%, 
stop loss in pips.

&nbsp;

As this somewhat depends on your denomination etc, I have chosen the USDCAD pair, and my account is in USD.  My account balance is $500, I will risk 1.5%, and want a stop loss in pips of 30.  I use the current price for USDCAD of 1.34816.  I am using 50:1 leverage if that is needed at all (don't think it is).

&nbsp;

I use the position size via babypips.com, here is a pic: http://i.imgur.com/1jKKiWp.png

&nbsp;

And I get that I should open a position with 3370 units (or 0.03370 lots, rounded to 0.03 lots in MT4).

&nbsp;

I confirm this calculation by hand, using (inspired by this discussion: http://www.babypips.com/school/undergraduate/senior-year/position-sizing/calculating-position-sizes.html)

&nbsp;

amount risked in USD = (500USD*0.015) = 7.5 USD risked

&nbsp;

how many CAD is this?
(1.34816CAD/USD) * (7.5USD) = 10.1112 CAD risked.

&nbsp;

how much CAD is risked per pip?
(10.1112CAD/30pips) = 0.3370CAD/pip

&nbsp;

now, one thing I might be getting wrong here, but I had to ""read between the lines"" and say that for a standard lot (100,000 units), 10 CAD constitutes one pip.  Note that it is not 10USD, but 10CAD, my counter currency (second currency in the pair).  Now, finally,

&nbsp;

(0.3370CAD/pip) * (100000units/10CAD) = 0.03370 lots or 3370 units

&nbsp;

As output by the babypips calculator.  Now the problem is, when I go to MT4 and place this trade with 0.03 lots, then I move my stop loss or take profit 30 pips away, it says it is only 0.67 USD, and not 7.5USD as it should be....(pic here:http://i.imgur.com/jidgGdE.png).  I realize I rounded 0.0337 lots to 0.03lots, but it isn't even close.

&nbsp;

In summary, 30 pips is 0.67USD in MT4 and not 7.5USD as expected.  Any idea what I am doing wrong?  If I need to be more explicit please let me know.  

&nbsp;

I cannot believe I have to ask this, as I have been reading all over, just haven't seen it in a form that makes sense to me (it is a problem with me, as I am sure the solution is right in front of my eyes, I just don't see it).

Firstly thanks for this subreddit, I really enjoying browsing it and reading responses to question I would never have thought of myself.

I'm currently on a demo account at FXCM doing some training and I have read the guide at babypips.com (which was great, found it recommended on this subreddit). 

I do however have a few questions of my own and I apologise they are probably very newbish. These questions are quite varied, so even if you can only answer one or two I would be so grateful.

- Do I understand correctly that for a trade to be profitable I need to make back the spread to break even and then above that is profit.

- Further to that, is it better to initiate a trade when the spread is high, so you can cash out when the spread is lower? Or that's not worth worrying about and just focus on the buy and sell rate?

- Why does the spread change so much?

- On the FXCM client, it says ""AUD/Point"" is this pip value?

- what does ""IOC"" and ""FOK"" mean?

- What is trailing?

- Where do you source your news from? Do you use an RSS aggregator?

- Thoughts on the FXCM platform?

- Thoughts on trading on currency pairs that aren't your default currency (eg: I'm AUD and thinking of trading on EUR/USD?

- Under the P/L part, does that include the spread?

- What number is the P/L based on? For example, I put atest order up for 1000 AUD/USD and it says gross P/L of 1.81. Does that mean Ive made a profit of $1.81 if I sell right now?",6,1.0

I longed EURUSD on January 2nd at a price of 1,04715. The reason I entered this trade was that, following the news, I thought that the growing tension between USA and Russia and the current calm in EU would lead to a slight improvement of the EUR over the USD. No indicators, except maybe a quick look at EMA and SMA on H4 and D1 period but it's secondary.

The % of my account in game is totally irrelevant because I did set the lot value in order to have the little amount on my account wiped in case it fell below 1,03 and to raise just above the minimal withdrawal amount required by my broker (so to say the dumb truth, I had $2.80 left and earned $2.25 on this trade). My TP was set at 1,05855, calculated to earn these $2.25, it was 0.20 nanolots. Leverage 1:25.

It was reached yesterday, so I did hold the trade for three days. What happened during these three days is what I am proud of. Often I thought about seizing profits when I saw them going positive by just a few cents. Often I thought about setting a S/L above my entry point when the price was beginning to rise. Often I asked myself if I should move the TP up or down as I could believe to spot a resistance a bit lower or a bit higher, depending on the time frame.  
What I am proud of, is that I sticked to the original plan ""set it and forget it"" and it worked! So, I wanted to share it with you despite the useless numbers of this trade as it clearly is about toying around with my bits and chips.

But then I hear from other places, such as google:

""The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money. As interest rates rise, the cost to borrow money goes up resulting in less demand for money and credit. Alternatively, as interest rates fall, the cost of borrowing money declines causing higher demand for money and credit.""

Recap: The Turkish political system and economy is shit, with no hope in the short or middle term.

As Erdogan grows stronger, the political system grows more and more into a one-man show. At this time, today as a matter of fact, a proposal has been brought to the parliament. The issue is about changing the political system into a Presidency ( as opposed to what Turkey has right now, a parliamentary democracy(!) ). The timeframe they propose is two weeks from now (24 January).

When this happens and Erdogan becomes President, the economy will suffer even more as Erdogan's one-man rule will basically turn Turkey into a system where it is even more nepotist and more corrupt (for instance, right now the Minister of Energy is his son-in-law, you figure the rest).

Stuff like this will become ever more prevalent and the already fucked Turkish economy will start to take it in all holes. 

When is this due? The main date is the 24th of January, when Erdogan will push this proposal/bill thru the parliament. Once he does, and he will (explanation below), the switch to a presidential system will be taken to the people in the form of a referendum.

Why it is a given Erdogan will be able to push this thru the parliament?: He needs a minimum of 330 votes. His ruling majority party has 316 seats/votes. His bought henchman, the leader of the nationalist party who already stated multiple times that he will vote yes to the presidential system in the parliament and the referendum, represents 39 seats/votes. That is 355. There will, of course, be those that resign from the nationalist party due to conflicting viewpoints, but so far, only 2-3, maybe 4 have done so. This shows the rest of the nationalist party MPs will pretty much stay in place and vote yes.

Bottom line: Erdogan will achieve at least 330 votes come 24 Jan. or whenever it is brought to the vote in the parliament (I say ""whenever"" because there could be snags, etc., but the point is, he WILL get his 330 votes sooner or later, with 24 Jan. being the earliest date)

As it is a well-documented fact that Erdogan's party rigs every election, once he gets 330 votes and the issue turns into a full-fledged referendum, he will rig the fuck out of it and gain the presidency.

That's the gist. 

Crucial point: Don't wait till the results of the referendum, it will be too late. The 24th of January (or a later date when he gets his 330 votes in the parliament) is the real date when his presidency will or or not be decided, not the actual referendum, because, like I said, that is a given.

If you read through it you can see that i am a **pattern trader** (not sure if this is the correct term for it)

but that is how i trade and for the most part i am profitable and it works, BUT i want to learn what i see here, where people actually post their analysis on WHY they think a certain pair is going to move up or down and post it on the chart as to why.


**(NOTE: THE BELOW IS FROM A COMMENT I POSTED 23 DAYS AGO)**


**My strategy is:**

For example right now I have a Buy on the EURUSD for .01
I am currently losing -8.14 at BUY 1.04730
I know when losing anything in the 7 dollar range to sell on my bigger account.
It doesnt really involve time frames much as it does overall movement of a currency, currently the EURUSD is moving down.
So thats where im going.

**I have 1 sell lot at 7 dollars at 1.04018 currently at $476 blue**

**I have 1 sell lot at 6 dollars at 1.03980 currently at $1.92 Blue**

**I have 1 sell lot at 5 dollars at 1.03896 currently at -$185 red**

**I have 1 sell lot at 4 dollars at 1.03940 currently at $24 blue**

**I have 1 sell lot at 3 dollars at 1.03944 currently at $33 blue**

**I have 1 sell lot at 2 dollars at 1.03865 currently at -$136 red**

**I have 1 sell lot at 1 dollar at 1.03833 currently at -$95 red**

my initital buy was at 1.04730, which is how i recognize the pattern.


currently up $203 with movement for shorting


The M30 and H1 frame are at peak so im expecting it to go back down to me losing about -$11.00 peak low on the smaller account because it has already hit that today for resistance


so whatever that makes me for the day and im out

**(NOTE: THE ABOVE WAS FROM A COMMENT I POSTED 23 DAYS AGO)**


**EDIT 1:** Its more of a personal technique which i found works like 80-90% of the time for me so i understand why it wouldn't work for you. At least not immediately. I've been doing this for over 6 months so i have a bit more experience with this under my belt, and while im not an experienced Forex trader whatsoever. I feel like i have found what works for me. I hope what i wrote down help id take screenshots but im working at the moment


What i want to learn is **[THIS](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/chart_of_the_day/2017/01/13/The-AUDUSD-Advance-Stalls-Under-.7524.html)**


Do i just go around **www.dailyFX.com** and see what they do or what programs do you use for those lines, how do you make an estimate of where exactly to buy and sell. Where you think the direction is moving and when you think its going to stop.


**TL;DR** want to learn how to chart analysis for pairs, including exact BUY numbers, SELL numbers and where it is going to stop. Currently pattern trader. Dont use charts to analyze much apart from generic direction. Teach me senpais

2187,2017-01-23,Understanding the Reserve Numbers,"Okay so I began my trading career in equities in June 2013. In September 2015, I found out about the forex markets and it's become my niche market to trade due to my background in economics and finance. As with all economic theories, it can become quite complex trying to analyze things in simplistic terms such as ""if country A is doing this, then this means country A is attempting to appreciate or depreciate their currency.""

I am beginning to become quite successful utilizing technical trading parameters where I only rely on charting and risk 1% account value per trade with the expectation of making 2%-4% if it becomes profitable. If you do the math, this requires only winning 33% of the time to breakeven and as of now after really working at it the last 2 months, I am currently up 6% to start the year with a lowest downside risk of approximately -2.5%.

But I want to up my fundamental game by understanding where the big players (Central Banks, Institutions, etc) are creating these consolidating bases, ranges, etc. One key indicator I found is the Foreign Reserves numbers. This tells us what a country is attempting to do to its currency (appreciate or depreciate it). Now take a look at this video:
https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/forex-trade-topic/currency-reserves/v/accumulating-foreign-currency-reserves

I need some help understanding this in simplistic trading terms. Does this mean that if, for example, the US Central Bank's Foreign Reserves decrease over a period, the US Central Bank is selling foreign currencies to acquire (buy) dollars leaving the USD supply decreased, therefore they are attempting to appreciate the dollar?

Please keep it simple by stating in terms of e.g. ""If a countries central bank is decreasing their foreign reserves, they are attempting to appreciate their currency."" Thanks all.",2,1.0

Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the USD is too strong and that it needs to weaken to be compatitave in the ""Global Arena"". I am not a PhD in Forex but for something to go down another has to go up and take that position. 

(1) From commentation I have read and watched the Chinese Yuan has almost doubled in strength over the last 30years and with a potential USD weakness could we see the USDCHY be at a 1:1 ratio??

(2) UK is still in litigations over how it will break away from the EU and in the current ""Short"" they are experience the reaction in general goods pricing. UK is in a strange position as it has to finish playing its hand before we can find a the plateau on if the GBP gain regain the strength it once had over the USD

(3) EURO is still trying to find support in the global currency and may seem as a strong leader with the decrease in USD strength. They currently received a huge influx of workers from the muslim world and if they can manage security issues and manage the labor force they may prove to be champion in the overall picture.

2222,2017-02-07,New Beginner info / FAQ section for futures,"I feel like with all the cheating and drama going on with spot fx we should at the very least have a dedicated section on the right for guidance on futures contracts.

The shady Cypriot brokers and ones on other random islands are lying and selling a dream so let's take a look at the reality of spot fx...

Currency markets are the most liquid and active markets of any sector. However, there is also a great deal of misinformation, slick advertising, and even outright deception regarding this $2 Trillion Dollar a Day marketplace. For starters, a large percentage of that $2 Trillion is traded through what is referred to as the interbank market. The interbank market is the top-level foreign exchange market where banks exchange different currencies. This **trading between banks is not accessible to retail traders** and is estimated to account for the vast majority of the Trillion Dollar liquidity factor that attracts so many retail traders in the first place.

Here are a few of the reasons to trade futures:

-Level playing field for all participants

-Deep liquidity on major currency contracts

-Safety and security of central clearing

If your Forex brokerage firm uses a dealing desk, your buy and sell orders never actually reach the true Forex market.  In other words, you do not have access to the inter-bank market.  Instead you are buying and selling at prices set, and potentially manipulated by the dealing desk. This is known as **conflict of interest.**

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange guarantees each transaction. **Futures contracts are legally binding!** This means that if you go long a currency futures contract and your speculation was correct, you will walk away from the trade with your profit **even if the person that took the other side of the trade fails to pay.** This is what we call **counterparty risk.**

Take a moment, have a break and take a look at all the horror stories on forex factory, for instance.

Whether you are a large institution or an individual trader, everyone is on equal footing when it comes to pricing currency futures. **EVERYBODY** gets the same price regardless of who you are (individual or mega bank). Best price wins, it is as simple as that — something that is not always the case in the fragmented OTC FX market. The spreads are also very tight if you trade liquid future contracts.

Spot fx brokers also control their price feeds. They can widen the spreads as they see fit and they can really screw you over if they want to. Believe me when I say that most fx brokers don't want you to win! Even the ones that claim to have liquidity providers... Those are nothing but price feeds. Quotes. Nothing more....

And Forex firms offering a ""fixed"" 3-5 point spread may not be charging traders commission outright, or even in a form that shows up on an account statement, but there are significant costs built into the synthetic market that they provide to you.

No middle man, no market maker. Yes, Forex is an electronic market, but your order still ends up on a ""dealing desk"" where a human handles your order. Or an algorithm... Basically, a Market Maker. He could make you or break you. With E-mini Futures you have a level playing field. You trade on a centralised and CFTC regulated exchange. Whether you're Goldman Sachs or Joe from Idaho, you get equal treatment!

If you're worried about Liquidity - 1.5-3m contracts trade hands everyday on the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Contract. If you want in or out of a position, there is almost always someone waiting and willing to take the other side of your trade (24/5) just 1 tick away. This simply isn't true for all Forex Pairs. 

Low Cost of Doing Business - Commissions on a self directed SP500 E-mini Trade (ES) should be no more than $3.00 per side or $6.00 per round turn. While many Forex Brokers tout ""Zero Commission"", we all know there's no free lunch. Forex Brokers don't need to charge a commission because they make money off of the bid/ask spread ""they create"" and then take the other side of your trade. Run the numbers... for every $100 in profits or loss, you will spend a larger % in ""cost of doing business"" in the Forex Market than you will in the S&P E-mini Market. Don't take my word for it... go take some real trades and you'll quickly see the truth.

Zero Interest - If you you trade the ES intraday, expect to put up $500 per contract as a ""bond"" for lack of a better term. That's it. No hidden cost. Forex however, has a ""cost of carry"" associated which means interest may be charged or paid on positions taken.

Fiduciary Responsibility - Even regulated US Forex firms are not required to segregate customer funds. If a regulated firm goes under, you do not have the protection of the CFTC and the NFA as you do in the Futures Markets.

Turn ON The Volume Please - In Forex, since there is no centralised exchange, **it is impossible to get a true read on volume.** Not so with the S&P 500 ""ES"" E-mini. Simply turn on the volume indicator and you have exact numbers for Volume Analysis. **GS and CITI have huge research departments with hundreds of employees, but they know nothing about volume that you don't know via a free indicator on your direct access trading platform. Just one more example of the level playing field we constantly speak of.**

Centralised Clearing - All trades are cleared via the CME - Chicago Mercantile Exchange. **All trades, including time and sales, are public information and posted in real time.**

Edit: By the way, if you're worried about discrepancies, **currency futures charts look almost exactly the same as their spot fx siblings**! So you can easily apply your current strategy to this market, too! 

A great example would be **""M6E"" vs ""EUR/USD""**

2231,2017-02-14,Comments so far 2 Weeks in.,"I feel like I ought to post something since it's been a couple weeks. After making my first $9, I proceeded to try trading the more dominant trend of GDP/USD (selling) and managed to lose $60. This is the point where I pulled the E-brake and let things percolate. I made two errors (which are arguable depending on what kind of trader you are).

First: I tried to recover my losses by diversifying currencies and trading simultaneously. This was a mistake in that it played into my habit of being reckless. Statistically it makes sense when your win/loss is >50% and you have something like a 3:1 Limit:Stop ratio...but you can't really get greater than 50% W/L if you don't get a feel for the dynamics of a system. Moreso, you need to set your Limit/Stop thresholds outside of the short term noise, which I've found more difficult. From what I've learned, every currency behaves differently. (In general, the USD/JPY is very noisy and sporadic, while GDP/USD is less noisy with large general trends).

Second: I stopped trading. This was a mistake in that I got inside of my own head. It's a $1000 class in economics, at this point. I need to stop focusing on profits/losses and focus on longer term strategies (30 minute charts as opposed to 1 minute and larger pip swings).

My current strategy is to continue selling the pound, but with frequent breaks every 30 pips or so to lock-in my profits. I feel like I've got a good idea of when the market is going to turn (long periods of sideways movement). But am often unsure of whether to try to trade with the upswings (buying), or to try selling, and praying it doesn't break through the resistance.  I've gotten negative feedback from attempting both, but my sample size is too small. 

Is it okay to branch out to simultaneous currencies in the coming months?

Is it stupid to wait out upswings as opposed to trading with them?

Where the hell do you put your lines when you're plotting resistance (the trend is downward, but the price always manages to break through)?

If I'm only trading one currency, is it okay to allot all of my balance for the margin?

2232,2017-02-14,"Multi-currency deposit / withdrawals, European currency exchange market, which?","Hi,

I am looking for a cheap way to exchange currencies mostly between EUR and PLN (but sometimes USD/PLN, USD/EUR, GBP/PLN, GBP/EUR, GBP/USD etc.). I need to deposit money in one currency, do the transaction and withdraw in another currency. That means that deposit and withdrawal bank accounts would be different, as I would have to use my currency accounts. I don't want my bank to apply their poor exchange rate.

I've used some online currency exchanges, but the best effective fee I get so far is around 0.31%. I am looking to go somewhere 0.1% and I believe that finding online currency exchange market, where I could place a bid/ask offer and wait for the seller/buyer could allow me to do that.

I've found some online currency brokers, but either they don't support multiple currencies (what a paradox) deposit / withdrawals
or
their withdrawal fee is around 20 currency units, which makes this business only working if I exchange money in chunks bigger than 20k, but that's too much risk to me

Do you think of any real market which does support currencies?
I just want to put let's say 2000USD and 2000EUR and maybe 1000PLN, play with people, resulting in maybe 16000PLN and 800EUR, then I would like to withdraw PLN onto PLN bank account and EUR onto EUR bank account. Am I asking for too much? It sounds to me so natural using Bitcoin exchange markets, where you can have multiple currencies and crypto-currencies and all seem to be working fine.

I tried to catch an upwards move from this pair a few weeks ago and got stopped out but now it has actually hit rock bottom.  A very solid rock bottom in fact not just a thin glass floor.  The level price is currently on has been holding for years now and Everytime it's been trifled with it has thrown price way up into the air eventually.

Entry: Long, 1.37ish(right now)

Stop: 1.365 or slightly lower depending on your risk tolerance 

Take profit: I target the 161 as shown on the D1 so about 1.46(beautiful).
If you want to be safer 1.43 is a pretty sure thing if this reverses.
And if you want to be riskier or just hold the trade longer it is possible it could hit the 272 which is sitting at 1.5 flat.

Personally I will look to the 1.5 zone for my own TP but that mostly depends on how quickly it rises when it does.

Analysis: sitting at that beefy foundation of 1.37-1.36 while also being oversold on stochastics on the D1 and close on the W1.  Volume is just something I keep on my charts for lower timeframes so you can ignore that.

Now for uncertainties, I do not follow the EUR or AUD very closely on the fundamentals side of things so I am not sure of what is going on with their economics.

2275,2017-03-07,"USD ""Pricing in the interest rate Theory""","So we talked about this last week with the whole ""interest rate gets priced in before the announcement"" I understand that it gets priced in before. I also understand if this happens then the interest rate announcement will not have a large effect unless it's a bigger rate hike than expected.

As of Friday I saw a few Fed hike calculators were saying a 90-98% chance of a hike from 30% in the beginning of the same week. 

Now, my brain works using logic and common sense so when I try to think of where or when the markets would price in the interest rate I think ""Well they wouldn't price in an interest rate hike if the likelihood of it happening is low, right?"".  Why would you spend the effort and time and resources moving price to factor in something that has low odds of occurring?  So if this were the case I would assume the market was pricing in no rate hike up until the point where the chance of it happening began to rise significantly.

So back to my brain and it's thoughts on this price being factored in.  Since the probability flipped 180 as of Friday (Yellen being the all knowing one) I would assume the market would want to factor in the interest rate hike before it happens. And there being only one week to do this(this week) is naturally and logically assume that the USD will be bullish this week. 

I came up with this theory on Friday, I was already long USD but so far this week I'm seeing that so far I am correct in my assumptions. I do know about the Nonfarm Payroll on Friday along with unemployment and I do know this is a big player in the hike decison, but seeing as it is on Friday I think that the dollar will still be bullish until that announcement with that announcement being the possible reversal point.  

I will remain long USD until either Friday or the rate hike (most likely the rate decision).

Thoughts and theories are welcome my tinfoil hat is always ready.

Data Item | Expected impact on USD 
:-- | :-:
Headline +235k vs 197k Consensus | Firmly Bullish
Prior 227k. Revised to 238k | Bullish
Unemployment rate 4.7% vs 4.7% exp. Prior 4.8% | Bullish
Average hourly earnings 0.2% vs 0.3% exp m/m. Prior 0.1%. Revised to 0.2% | Neutral/Bearish(1) 
Average weekly hours 34.4 vs 34.4 exp. Prior 34.4 | Neutral 
Participation rate 63.0% vs 62.9% prior | Weakly bullish
Private payrolls 227k vs 193k ecp. Prior 237k. Revised to 221k | Bullish
Manufacturing 28k vs 10k exp. Prior 5k. Revised to 11k | Bullish 
Government 8k vs -10k prior. Revised to 17k | Neutral
 
^^(1) This is subtle and debatable, but one could interpret the flat trajectory of AHE as evidence of weaker than anticipated wage inflationary pressures. At best it's a slightly weak facet of an otherwise strong report.

Obviously this are just my interpretation of the data, but to be clear, I'm trying to represent what the *mainstream market conventional wisdom* would say, and not my own personal opinion on the economics of the situation. I think that it's a pretty non-controversial representation.

Secondly let's look at the currency impacts:

* **Spot FX market response to US NFP data**


Currency Pair | Market Response
:-- | :-:
EURUSD |     Unequivocally and powerful bearish USD  
USDJPY |    Significant price conflict, ultimately somewhat bearish USD    
GBPUSD |    Mixed picture, ultimately weakly bearish USD  
USDCAD |  Bearish USD with partial recovery  
USDCHF | Bearish USD but reasonable support of USD  
AUDUSD |  Bearish USD  
NZDUSD |  Bearish USD but reasonable support of USD  
USDMXN |  Bearish USD   
XAUUSD |   Bearish USD  

This is *exceptionally noteworthy*.

A NFP headline that met expectations and only inspired a neutral USD response would be very noteworthy alone, but to see such vigorous selling of the USD across the board is giant neon sign that something is afoot.

It is also very telling that there is divergence in the responses with each currency pair. Particularly telling is that sentiment regarding EURUSD is markedly different to USDJPY. Putting together the reaction to the news profile can give you a good idea where a currency stands versus the US dollar, and what the bank's plans for it are.

* **So what does this mean?**

It means that *something is afoot*. Exactly what that might be is less clear cut than analysing the response as per above.

A good item to check  for more information is the Fed Futures Fund sentiment: http://cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html

After NFP, it rose to over 90%, so it couldn't be more clear that the market is essentially absolutely certain there will be a rate hike.

This leads us to the most face value interpretation of events:

The market expects a rate hike at FOMC, however the major players believe that the pricing in of the hike has been overdone, and are now selling off. The likely outcome of this is that FOMC day sees a rate hike, USD soars on the announcement, only to be driven down either immediately, or in the short term, as banks/mega-fund take profit and rebalance portfolios.

A far less likely interpretation, but one that will surface should a USD sell off eventuate, is that ""they know something the public don't"". Either that there's not going to be a rate hike, or that the US is about to have a major political risk event. Both are plausible given current events, but I would not rate these as sensibly tradeable theories given that one can account for the same event sequence with a conventional and very vanilla financial theory: the USD is simply overbought with respect to the underlying like future capital flows.

Even more unlikely, but still possible is that this is market manipulation to try and catch the market offside for a further bull run with the rate hike. The NFP data release is a vulnerable point in the market where people are willing to inject large amounts of speculative capital based solely on what price is doing at the moment, rather than having any long term bias. Money in a few minutes, and you don't care which way price rolls. This makes it much easier for major players to convince speculators (and speculative HFT algorithms) to roll a certain way, just so they can get better position. I'm not convinced this is the case here though, usually that sort of manipulative activity is reserved for 'mid-importance' news. If this is the case, then there will be  limitations to how far the market is driven in a certain direction, and one would expect certain technical barriers to be preserved. 

It's also worth noting that the mix of responses lends itself to interpretation. USD weakness against EUR and the commodity currencies, but significantly lesser against the JPY and CHF suggest that the market view is that the global environment still favours Risk On over Risk Off positioning. 

* **So how should you trade it?**

Do I look like a millionaire to you? I made more comment karma than money trading last week, and that was just one upvote on a /r/C25k post.

Besides, I can't tell you how to trade your system. What is important, though is that if you are asking how to trade this, then you have a deficiency in either your trading system or your analytical system. Because these events occur reliably in the market, and you need to have some systematic way to deal with the knowledge, which includes ignoring this as ""funnymentals"". 

Additionally, this is just one data point, albeit a very, very significant one in my book.

Stay safe out there USD bulls, and good luck to those who want to ride the countertrend waves should they come to fruition. Already the EURUSD is attacking critical longterm down trendlines, and the AUDUSD is setting its sites on reversing what should have been a powerful bear breakout. Of course, the market's underlying sentiment can also turn on a dime, usually at the expense of yours.

When it comes to theories about what is *happening in the market*, it's much harder to apply similar standards because many things don't appear on the charts. However, this often means we fail to even try.

This is bad practice. We should be willing to challenge our own, and other's theories about the market, as well as investigate out-of-the-box theories, by comparing them to available chart evidence. 



**Edit: /u/squitstoomuch has drawn my attention to the fact that my analysis and understanding of the situation has some serious, if not fatal flaws. Rather than delete the post, I'll leave it up because looking at other people's mistakes is often useful, and it's still a good idea to compare your ideas to the charts and see if the market validates them. Grossly incorrect stuff has strike throughs, the rest still stands.**

~~For example, a very common analysis you will hear after the combination of rate decision and Governor press conference is that the overall direction of movement can be accounted for by what was said in the conference.~~

~~This is something you can assess by looking at the charts.~~

**Proposition 1: The USD fell largely due to Yellen's comments implying future rate trajectories**

Consider: 

M1 EURUSD  
http://i.imgur.com/MS7ceQf.png

M1 USDJPY  
http://i.imgur.com/JeHI8qw.png

You can see that the majority of the price movement against the USD happens within the first ten minutes after the rate release, and within that, the majority of the move happened within the first minute. 


~~Logic dictates that NONE of this movement was related to the content of the speech, simply because the speech had not been given yet.~~

You can also see that although there was movement throughout the speech, it managed to only depress the USD an additional third compared to the rate release.

~~How you choose to interpret this is up to you, but at least you can now frame the 'it was Yellen's speech that did it' theories in the context of some irrefutable evidence.~~

~~My personal interpretation is that whilst the speech content strongly influences price, and did further depress the USD, it was not the *original motivator for the drop*. Nor was it the main determinant of the magnitude of the drop in the value of the USD, because both of those happened before she ever opened her mouth.~~
~~    

Let's look at some more propositions. 

**Proposition 2: You should trade what happened last time** 

USDJPY H1 chart from 14th December 2016, the previous time rates were raised.
FOMC raises Fed Fund Rate, USD goes:

http://i.imgur.com/qL7upT7.png

... up. So if you had simply looked at  what happened last time, and then bought this time, you would have lost money. I'm going to strongly recommend that nobody short the USD for the next rate hike *just because* it went down this time!  
 

**Proposition 3: You could have just predicted the movement on technicals.**

Well...

http://i.imgur.com/zYOlVmw.png

... as it turns out,  one of the most basic, elementary technical strategies (trendline + horizontal resistance) would have gotten you in nicely this time, at least on USDJPY. The EURUSD set-up was a bit more advanced, but still straightforward in the context of the essentially guaranteed rate decision.

http://i.imgur.com/L8B7s1K.png

Interestingly, pivot points perfectly predicted the extent of the day's price movement this time round.

USDJPY (D)

http://i.imgur.com/emY42Nn.png

EURUSD (H1)

http://i.imgur.com/fD8UDss.png

(Note the different timeframes. This may just be a case of coincidence, but I will say that ever since I put them on my charts, they've been very useful for exactly this sort of thing: how far the market will go before a pause or a retrace).

**Proposition 4: the market is irrational and unpredictable**

I don't have any strong evidence to disprove this, but  I will say that the NFP price action was a big red flag that something like this was going to happen on FOMC day, and that there are [clear, strongly repeatable analytical approaches](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/5yq8sd/why_the_markets_reaction_to_the_nonfarm_payrolls/) that predicted an outcome like this. Many people were not the least bit surprised.

^^^^^^^^^^. 


Finally, I'd like to suggest that this is much more than just ""pricing in"". I don't have the time nor patience to go through my archives and dig out every ""priced in"" economic release that I've ever tried to trade, so I'll leave the evidence hunt for those more curious. 

But in my experience, when the market has priced an event in, and that event happens, the usual result is ... nothing. This is what 'pricing in' means, that price is already correct in regards to that information.

If anything actually happens, it's usually counter-intuitive, and that means that the big banks are using the event to hustle price about. 

As a footnote, that's not the only way they hustle price. One thing they also like to use talking heads to influence market sentiment:  http://news.forexlive.com/!/goldman-sachs-see-a-second-fed-hike-in-june-20170310 (This bulletin is saying there will be faster rate hikes, ie investors should buy USD. You might wonder why Goldman would risk their reputation by putting their name behind directions they're not trading, and the easy answer is that nobody remembers these bulletins, but everyone remembers the end of year profits of the bank.

2291,2017-03-16,I believe I know why USD tanked yesterday after FOMC statement,"My thanks go to /u/alotmorealots for writing such a [nice post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/5zoo2z/a_forensic_approach_to_trading_examining_the_fomc/). It really made me think and search why EUR/USD reacted as it did, though I did not trade it this time.

If you look at the [30 Day Federal Funds Futures chart](https://s.tradingview.com/x/CXwXi297/), you will a significant upward movement yesterday. It coincides with the FOMC statement release time if you switch to [intraday](https://s.tradingview.com/x/Grzg1mel/). When the fed funds futures goes up, it means that the lower interest rates are expected. Thus, **fed funds futures market has clearly interpreted the statement as such that implies lower future interest rates**. It was likely interpreted that way by big USD speculators as well (otherwise, it would create a huge arbitrage opportunity between FF futures and USD spot markets). Of course, it brought weakness to the US dollar across all currency pairs.

The exact reasons for such interpretation are unclear to me, but I guess some big institutional market participants had hoped that Yellen would produce a more hawkish statement and/or projections (though they were not quite dovish either - see [difference with February statement](http://graphics.wsj.com/fed-statement-tracker/)).

- But there are differences 
   
 - the spreads
  
  - the volatility

  - pip per price vs. price per day via ATR

  - the emotions involved because it’s harder to manage two pairs instead of one  

 - It can also open more playing room 

   - you can change the weighting (buying/selling more of one of the currencies)

   - you can take of a USD profit by cancelling one of the other currency, making USD vs other

This Weekend Analysis for the Week Ahead

the two lessons i learned last week i applied them partially,

Lesson 1 : Try Not to miss a trade it is the same like losing money

Missed a lot out of fear and i think the lake of experince of chart time

Lesson 2 : DON'T BE GREEDY 

I Lost an easy 2% win because i didn't follow it and extended my TP target on USDCAD, Applied it to other Pairs though like the AUDUSD

I have a question purely out of greed (Really?) 

at what point should i increase my risk from 1% to 2%?

Or Should i take the Extra 1% in scaling in a trade? how to scale though when the target is 2:1 ??

about programming mql4,

i did a few robots on some strategies i made earlier in the forex path.

and i did backtest , Account Blown.

Actually it is good way for checking the validity if a strategy without wasting a lot of time forward testing it,

Manual back test is also controlled by emotions so i saw all my strategies winners but they never was

That give me a lot of time to test new strategies 

That is it this weekend, I hope you guys have a good week and 

please review my analysis for the week ahead and share your advice with me.

2314,2017-04-04,THE PERFECT GARTLEY ON AUD/USD,"http://imgur.com/a/OH8vQ

There is a potential Gartley pattern setting up on the AUD/USD 4 hour chart. I understand that some people are not familiar with advanced pattern formations, so I'll briefly show you the analysis behind this pattern.

**X-A leg**: This is the longest leg of the pattern, also known as an impulse leg. It's called an impulse leg because it sticks out very clearly on a chart.

**A-B leg**: In a conventional Gartley pattern, the AB leg is a **61.8%** retracement of the impulse leg. As seen from the chart price made a push into that level, but respected and rejected that Fibonacci level.

**B-C leg**: Typically, the BC leg is a **38.2% - 61.8%** retracement of the AB leg. In this example, price goes slightly pass the **50%** retracement before reversing. There may be different rules for a Gartley pattern to different traders, however, I will only go through the conventional levels for a valid Gartley pattern.

**C-D leg**: Also known as the final leg, the completion of this leg may vary between traders. Typically, the **127.2%** extension of the AB leg is used. Another common way traders determine this leg is by using the **78.6%** retracement of the XA leg. In this example, the **78.6%** retracement lines up very nicely on top of the **127.2%** extension, and that's why I call this the ""perfect Gartley.""

Moreover, if you were to look left, you'll see that we have pretty decent support as price has respected that area twice previously. In most of my analysis, if you've read some of my other posts, you'll know that I value structure more than anything else. 

So that sums up a potential long opportunity on the AUD/USD. I will not be getting into specifics of entries and exits because that's up to an individual's trading rules and plan.

Some redditors have asked me recently if I write or post my analysis elsewhere. As a matter of fact, I do. If you are interested, I am a guest blogger on [here](https://snail-trading.com).

1. Saw trendline for USD/JPY about to touch again and seemed extremely unlikely to break
2. RSI was still high so all predicted it to crash down. 
3. at about 15-5 mins before the FOMC took place saw a pin bar
4. Executed a sell on the pair and took profits about 40 pips down (could have held but I take what I can no sense in being greedy)

So for all you new peeps out their starting to research the forex and thinking you can easily get rich quick if you just learn it. I have been studying the Forex since September and it is now April... I just predicted and was able to tell what the market was going to do, how the IT could fake it out ( which I was also able to predict :)) and being confident enough to stay in it, and then  only earning 40 pips for 6 months of work. So what should this experience should tell you: 
The market is kinda of like a sport (Football reference). You start out at age 5 and play flag football. Then you go from that to pads. Next comes working out everyday and practicing your skills just to start for the Varsity Team. If you are good and lucky enough you will be put on a College Team and be trained all year long and to the point where you might die. Lastly if you are one of the lucky few who makes it to the NFL and get paid the big bucks you will be working non-stop. You are always studying, practicing, reviewing your mistakes (thank the lord I am done with film on Saturday), making corrections and constantly adapting and learning to your environment. 

This is not something easily learned. Hell I am an idiot compared to the guys who have been doing this for only 2 years. But as long as you stick with it and dedicate your time and energy you will learn it. It is not impossible I know it may feel like it is impossible to be able to predict this thing that anyone in the world can change but it simply is predictable. Have fun with the experience of learning the market. It is like a ride on a rollercoaster but only you determine when you are off of the ride.

2319,2017-04-06,Question - going short on EUR/USD having your money in USD,"Hello ! My question may be a simple one, but I'd like to clarify this in my head.

So want to go short on EUR/USD, having let's say 1000$ in your account. Basically you sell euros and buy dollars. Having your money in $, how can you sell euros ? Do you have to convert your dollars in euros first, to be able to begin the transaction ? If so, what price should you use for initial conversion (usd -> eur) ? Is it the **ask** price for EUR/USD?

And then let's say you are on profit and you want to close your transaction, meaning that you sell your dollars and buy euros. Here you should use the **ask** price again right? Problem is now that you have all your money in EUR after transaction close, but you want to have your money in USD again. So you finally have to convert again EUR->USD using now the **bid** price. 

To conclude, you basically do you do 4 transactions (first and last steps are automated I guess) ? Is there a mistake in these steps? 

Thank you !",2,0.75
2320,2017-04-06,How Fed Funds Rate Works (and Why Forex Traders Should Care),"The aim of this post is to show how the current federal funds rate operation differs from its pre-crisis model and how it is important to Forex traders.

## Before 2008

When things were simple (before 2008), the Federal Reserve set its target **federal funds rate** (FFR) as a single number and made sure that the [**effective federal funds rate**](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/fed%20funds) (EFFR) is at the target level by performing **open market operations** (OMO). Those OMO normally included **repurchase agreements** (_repo_ or RP) to temporarily increase the reserves supply in the **federal funds market** (FFM) (and thus reduce the demand and the EFFR) and **reverse repurchase agreements** (RRP) to temporarily decrease the supply of reserves and drive the EFFR up. It worked very well because the total size of bank reserves was rather small ($15 billion) in pre-crisis times.

## Our times

Nowadays, when the Fed is holding [$2.27 trillion](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm) in reserve balances (as of March 27, 2017), the old scheme would not fare so well. There is no scarcity of reserve balances at all. To create it, the Fed would need to sell a big share of its securities to shrink the total reserves to manageable size. But that would create some problems — it would drive down the prices of those securities and would launch a series of unpredictable market feedback loops. Instead, what the Fed is doing since 2008 is setting a target FFR as a range between two interest rates. For example, it is 0.75%-1.00% as of today while the EFFR, measured as volume-weighted median, was at 0.91% during the last 3 days.

### Ceiling rate

The Fed makes sure that the FFM respects the target bounds by setting the **interest on excess reserves** (IOER) to the top boundary rate. When 95% of the reserve balances are the excess balances (balances exceeding the required level), the IOER rate paid by the Fed to the banks for holding these reserves serves as the ceiling for the rate corridor. It may sound counter-intuitive, because IOER would have been a floor level if only the FFM was composed only of the banks. However, it is not the case. The [**government-sponsored enterprises**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-sponsored_enterprise) (GSE), such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal Home Loan Banks, [comprise the bulk](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/12/whos-lending-in-the-fed-funds-market.html) of the FFM. GSEs do not earn IOER on reserve balances kept at the Fed. This creates an arbitrage opportunity for banks to borrow from GSEs and allocate the funds with the Fed to earn IOER. Consequently, the interest rate of GSE's loans to banks should be below IOER.

### Floor rate

And how about the floor of the rate range (the _0.75%_ part of today's target range)? It is enforced by the Fed through the OMO called **overnight repurchase agreement** (ON RRP). With it, the Fed can drain some reserves from the system by borrowing cash from market participants, giving them securities as a collateral. Since not only banks can earn interest on their funds with ON RRP (GSEs can also do it), this sets the _de facto_ lower boundary for the EFFR. Who would lend at a lower rate if they can choose to get at least this rate from the risk-less loan to the Fed? One important feature of the current system is that the EFFR does not cling to the upper side of the rate range (IOER) but hovers below it, falling down to near the ON RRP rate during the final day of the month. The reason for the former is that the banks pay [higher FDIC insurance fees](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedgfe/2016-79.html) when they borrow more. And the reason for the latter is that the banks need to follow the [Basel requirements](http://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3.htm), which limit their leverage, but are calculated based on the end-of-month balance sheet.

### Efficiency

As a result, we can see the EFFR fluctuating between ON RRP and IOER — well within the boundaries of the Fed's target FFR. The short-term interest rates (represented by the 3-month Treasury bills) roughly follow the EFFR, which means that the interest rates get propagated beyond the FFM. Note the EFFR spiking down on each last day of the month: 

[EFFR inside target FFR range with 3-month Treasury Bill rate for comparison](https://www.earnforex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/effr-inside-fftr-with-3mtb.png)

## Relation to Forex

So why should Forex traders care about this? Because effective federal funds rate and the Fed's ability to uphold it are even more important for the US dollar than the target rate set by the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) at its meetings. It is the higher EFFR that would stimulate banks buying more USD to park it either with the Fed or with the GSEs. It is the lower EFFR that would let banks to use the USD as a [carry trade](https://www.earnforex.com/forex-course/carry-trade/) short side. Now you see that any significant news concerning **GSE regulations**, **Basel III requirements**, or **FDIC insurance fee policies** could have tremendous influence on the USD rate based on how such news could affect the EFFR. As a currency trader, you have to be up-to-date with the expectations of the FFM participants regarding those three components. I recommend the following resources to stay up-to-date with those topics:

*   [New York Fed — Markets & Policy Implementation](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets) — for all important changes in how FFM functions.
*   [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) — the Fed board members might hint at the upcoming changes to how they will make sure that EFFR keeps within their target FFR.
*   [Bank for International Settlements](https://www.bis.org/) — for its news regarding Basel III development and implementation.
*   [FHLBanks Office of Finance](http://www.fhlb-of.com/) — for news on how Federal Home Loan Banks financial regulation changes.
*   [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation — Financial Institution Letters](https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/) — for anything related to changes in how FDIC fees work for depository institutions.

Of course, you can also use some financial news outlet of your choice that would cover all these topics.",38,0.91

I was short the EUR/USD from 1.0679 and was enjoying a nice 50pip continuing gain with a wide stop-loss. 

I took a flight for work and when I landed I saw what looks like a lovely ""stop hunt"" designed just for me.

Regardless of why this spike happened, whether it be a malicious stop-hunt or genuine world-news driven event - how can I better stay in the trade?

I figure my options are:

1) Have no automatic stop-losses - monitor everything myself - but that leads me to: Q: How do I know this is just a 15minute spike?

2) Have insanely wide stop losses, though I wouldn't have been able to keep it wide enough to protect me this time as it went way about the blue 50MA

I'm happy that my stop-loss worked, but upset that this spike prevented me from enjoying another 40+ pips.

[This chart](http://i.imgur.com/HC1GUtY.jpg) shows my original 30 pip SL, 30 pip TP, and my entry point. I entered during the bearish candle but could have waited a bit more.

I saw that in a general uptrend, gold had fallen into a bit of weakness and fallen below the short EMA, which it had generally been respecting. It moved below it but I was confident that the Daily UK Pivot would act as strong support.

It had also retraced to my trendline, which was another thing I thought would hold it up. Checking on the D1 chart, I do see an uptrend, whilst the current candle is bearish. So now I have quite a bit of confluence: a trendline, a Pivot point, an uptrend on the M15 and D1, with gold falling into weakness during the uptrend.

So now I'm confident I can win on this pullback, I calculate my S/L by drawing a crosshair from the recent swing high to the swing low, I decide to go for 30 pips, with a volume to risk 1% of my account.

The price action continues, and when I have over 15 pips of profit, I move my SL up to breakeven, but you can see illustrated on my chart where I show the original S/L in black text.

My take profit is illustrated with the dashed red line.

As you can see, to lose on this trade, it would have had to fall 30 pips, which means it would fall below the Long EMA. This would be very odd as you can see you from the chart it has never once dropped below the long ema, representing a nice strong uptrend. Granted, when I entered, the trend had begun to slow down and move sideways slightly.

My take profit was around the R1 level, so a good place to exit.",5,0.74
2334,2017-04-18,Setups This Week (17th - 21st April),"Hey everyone! I've gotten a lot of questions about missing last week's post and the answer is that I've been super-busy lately, but I'm back now if you're still interested!  

**Recap from last week**

1) CADJPY: My suspicions were confirmed and the price seems to be headed towards the formation of the shoulder at 80.601. Of course this is a speculative idea about predicting the formation of potential structures using previous knowledge, so I once again recommend the conservative approach here *if* the shoulder indeed forms. [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/CADJPY/Jvewpb7s-Potential-Inverse-Head-And-Shoulders-Pattern-on-CADJPY/)

2) EURUSD: Once again, this idea was a prediction about the formation of a potential structure, but I'll admit that my placement of the third drive's leg was incorrect. However, I posted an update a little while ago with the adjusted leg, and the structure has not been negated *so far*. The next few days should reveal the truth so I'm still monitoring this closely. [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURUSD/TcEVyJU3-Potential-Bearish-3-Drives-Pattern-on-EURUSD/)

**New Setups**

1) USDCHF: Expanding on my previous idea of apparent Double Top formation on this pair, I've gone into greater depth about the path that it might potentially take. The current trend that we can see the pair taking is outlined by the descending blue lines that form a clear channel. From this (and the overall double top ), we can see that there is a higher probability that the price will continue to fall within this channel compared to it breaking through and reversing the overall trend. The question then becomes: How far will it drop and what will it look like? The fibonacci retracement lines that I've used here line up very well with past major S&R levels where the price bounced off of. If the price drops into the green zone, we can predict that it will drop to the 0.786 level, making stops at the 0.5 and 0.6 levels where it may experience some brief consolidation. The RSI level is also identical to that seen on the 8/03/2017 where it experienced a minor reversal to keep the price within this descending channel . The price may even dip below the 0.96768 level but this works for the purpose of illustrating the inner-workings of trading a descending channel within an apparent double top formation. 
Of course this pattern could always turn on a dime, and although the USD is becoming calmer as a result of investors settling with Trump's presidency, there is still a chance that the price might adversely react and exit the channel entirely - so prepare accordingly. Entry: 1.00082 SL: 1.00716 (Adjust to channel borders) TP: 0.96768. [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDCHF/hZKWC09u-Descending-Channel-on-USDCHF/)

2) NZDCAD: What an ugly chart! I'm still waiting for a few ideas to hit their particular orders - and this is one of them. What we have here is a descending channel within a larger ascending channel . These are particularly great because you know for a fact that it's either going to bounce off the channel wall and push up or break the channel for a huge dive. 

As always, I like to play the odds so I'm going with the former. The price has already bounced off the wall but I'm still waiting for it to break the descending channel. This is because it still has the opportunity to go back down and bounce up again like we saw in May 2015. If it breaks we can expect it to hit 3 targets, the first of which is supported by the 0.236 fib retracement (which it's been adhering to judging by the 0.382 level as well). The second and third are very strong S&R levels that have been hit multiple times over the past few years. The question then becomes: What happens if it goes past Target 3? The high that we saw in November 2016 is an all-time high, so passing it means we'd be in uncharted territory. We can assume that the price will at least test a new high at that point - even if it might not break through. Entry: 0.93726 TP: 0.94418, 0.95654, 0.96321 SL: 0.93305 or 0.92415 if you're confident in the double bounce.

I really do appreciate the love from a lot of you so I hope to continue making these and that I'll be back in time for next week.

**Recap from last week**

1) USDCHF: So far so good on this pair; The price reversed at its peak just as the analysis predicted, and if you entered on this pair then you'd be up about 50 pips so far. Chump change if you ask me, but hopefully the consolidation at the 0.99576 S&R level (marked by the orange line) will come to a halt soon and continue its descent. [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDCHF/hZKWC09u-Descending-Channel-on-USDCHF/)

2) NZDCAD: This prediction is also coming true so far - with a much faster climb than expected too! The price broke out of the descending channel quite nicely and is up ~120 pips from the entry order. We're approximately 50% of the way to the final target! [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NZDCAD/doPsRgxI-NZDCAD-Poised-for-Breakout-450-pips/)


**New setups**

1) USDCAD: If you've been following some of my ideas then you'll know i'm a big fan of this pair - even if it hasn't been too cooperative with formations. I've noticed the USD settling in following Trump's presidency (despite the odd statement that makes it go haywire), so here I'm speculating about an apparent Double Top formation that may ultimately drop to the 1.32 mark. Target 1 here can also double as a more conservative entry as I expect there to be some extensive consolidation here (marked by the ~ sign) which falls in line with data going back to last year (The S&R level also lines up with the Fib Retracements). Target 2 is a little more lenient as the entire blue rectangular area has seen consolidation, so it all depends on how aggressive you want to be. Target 3 is the neckline, and if you are very conservative, this would be your preferred entry point which would still net you a few pips which are all but guaranteed if the price hits this spot. Finally, we have Target 4 which is the upper limit of an Hourly S&R area and where you should be aiming if you want to ride the entire wave down. 

Of course this is all for naught if Kashkari's speech on Monday is bullish on the USD, but if it isn't then we can see the drop happening about as fast as the one on the 15th of March. I personally do not like uncertainty regarding the news so I'm going to hold off on trading this until at least after Monday - even if it manages to hit the entry before. Entry: 1.34824, TP: 1.34576,1.33845, 1.32972, 1.32076, SL:1.35203. [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDCAD/py0RQVi5-Double-Top-Formation-on-USDCAD-250-pips/)

2) EURCAD: This idea's been posted on my page since the 13th of April as I was holding off on sharing it until it looked like the ABCD pattern was indeed forming. Though the price *still* has a change of negating the structure entirely, I thought i'd post it anyway as I'm still monitoring some other pairs that have not 'shown their hand' yet. Analysis: I was waiting to for this pair to show signs of a reversal off of the 0.618 retracement. Now that it has done that, we can predict a potential bearish long-term ABCD pattern forming here - assuming that the D leg goes to completion. If this happens, we can also predict that the price will hit the 1.272 retracement at the 1.47540 mark sometime in late May 2017 then come back down to any of the 3 fib retracement levels (Drawn in red and based on the A-D leg) in Early June. I'm also expecting minor consolidation on both the bullish and bearish drives between the 1.42993 and 1.43491 price levels that may end up determining which target is most likely to be hit. As we've seen in previous ABCD and 3-drive patterns, trading the C-D leg is very risky and I wouldn't really advise it. This is more of a proof of concept should the idea materialize. Aggressive Setup Entry: 1.41698 TP: 1.47586 SL: .1.40672 Conservative Setup Entry: 1.46586 TP: 1.43778, 1.42606, 1.41463 SL: 1.48319. If you took the aggressive entry, you would currently be up about 330 pips which is just over 50% of the way to the D leg completion. I wouldn't recommend jumping in at this point and would suggest the conservative entry. [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURCAD/U0nBtwAR-Potential-ABCD-Pattern-on-EURCAD-600-pips/)

I am using this example as my starting point, however it only explains one currency pair.  https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/fix-adapter-reference/pl-calculation-algorithm/understanding-pl-calculations/

My simplified example is more complicated because i have multiple currency pairs, can someone confirm if i am correct?.
Trades:

Day 1: Buy 10k USD/AUD @ 1.34             

Day 2: No Trades  (USD/AUD spot = 1.35)

Day 3: Buy 5k EUR/USD @ 1.09 (USD/AUD spot = 1.35;     EUR/USD @ 1.09)

PL

Day 1: Rate unchanged 0 unrealised PL

Day 2: rate as moved, so calculated unrealised PL of 100 AUD [(1.35 - 1.34)  * 13,400k]

Day 3: ?????

I assume i have to close out 5,450 USD from the open position to buy EUR, correct? And i should do that at the current USD/AUD rate?
Therefore day 3 PL should be:


Day 3:  Realised, (1.35 - 1.34) * (5,450) = 54.5
            Un - realised, (1.35 - 1.34) * (5,550) = 45.5

so in effect, in my program every time i buy a currency pair i should find open positions and then close them automagically at the market rate?

Not sure if this is the right sub, i hope it is though because someone should be able to answer this pretty quickly and hopefully others will find the answer interesting as well.

**Reasons to Trade**
 
Firstly, may strategy is based off Elliott Wave analysis and i've been tracking AUD/CAD work through a triangle pattern (3-3-3-3-3), which is a 5 wave structure where each wave subdivides into 3 waves. We are now in Wave C of Wave E with a nice pull back to get into this downward move.
 
Secondly, The AUD is tanking across most pairs, which is also inline with my EW analysis for these pairs. in addition to this, my analysis is that we still have about half way to go for these down moves.
 
Thirdly, 1.02000 is a lovely psychological point of reversal which also coincides with the previous recent high of 1.01994. This could be viewed as a double top without much convincing.

Fourthly and finally, from a fundamental point of view, the AUD is underperforming economically and this is threatening the currencies yield status. In addition to this the CAD is actually outperforming is latest economic data and is much further along their recovery. Also commentary like http://news.forexlive.com/!/is-morgan-stanley-giving-up-on-usd-bullishness-after-getting-stopped-20170424 also throws a little bit of confidence i have the right view of where things are headed.
 
 
**Entry parameters**
 
I won't enter until price breaks this mini trend line on the 1H/2H chart so my actual entry is a moving target.
Stops and placeholder entry are below:
 
Entry: 1.01926. Current price but i think it will be about 10 pips lower than that before if/when the trend line is broken. a close below the 12 SMA on 1H/2H is also an OK entry in my opinion.
 
Stop: 1.02705 (78 pips). This is the top of Wave B and highest high for over a month. more importantly, if price breaks this point then my analysis that Wave B has completed is wrong and i'm invalidated.
 
Target: 0.98567 (340 pips). This is a 100% extension of Wave A (from the start of Wave B for those that know know fib extensions). it also is the support of the encompassing Triangle chanel trend lines.

2376,2017-05-07,Setups This Week (8th May - 12th May),"Hey all, I know I said I'd be back for last week but I realized that I'd just be forcing myself to post premature ideas that are lower in 'quality' - especially since my ideas are usually long-term, so that didn't really sit well with me. 

**Recap from last week**

1) USDCAD: Oh boy, if I could hear the 'X' sound from America's Got Talent on cue, I would need it right about now. Though the USD has been under-performing lately, the CAD took that sentiment and dialed it up to 10 resulting in a pair that has broken through the daily local maximum and looking towards 1.40. Shit happens right? [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDCAD/py0RQVi5-Double-Top-Formation-on-USDCAD-250-pips/)

2) EURCAD: Unlike it's older brother that is still respecting the structure (EURUSD), the strength of the EUR following the first round of the French elections combined with CAD's weakness has resulted in a massive jump that has all but invalidated the ABCD pattern. However, if you managed to take the aggressive entry I posted on the idea,
 you would have gotten all 600 pips on the C-D leg completion which is a beautiful result for a 9 day trade. [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURCAD/U0nBtwAR-Potential-ABCD-Pattern-on-EURCAD-600-pips/)

**New Setups**

1) GBPUSD: What we can see here is a very clear channel that the pair has been trading in since the Brexit vote almost one year ago. From this, we can use fibonacci retracements to outline very clear and distinct levels that the price is using to bounce off of. As of today, the price seems to be entering a rather important decision point where it may attempt to break through the 0.618 level - indicating a rather significant bullish run for the pair. The alternative is that it may attempt to test the 0.5 level which is the border between the two adjacent channels, and from here it can either bounce upwards to test the 0.618 level again or it can break through it downwards indicating that the pair will likely stay in this lower channel. 

The GBP has been rallying as of late but the USD has also been gaining some traction. I would predict that although the USD has shown signs of life, it may be a short lived run compared to the GBP. So with regards to this structure, I would say that the price is headed back down to the 0.5 level to test it before rallying up and over the 0.618 level. The RSI indicates that the pair is very oversold so it seems to support this prediction of a brief bearish trend followed by an OVERALL bullish trend . I stress that word because we can always expect some consolidation and brief reversals off the major S&R levels outlined here. Assuming the price breaks through the 0.618 level, we'll be analyzing the upper channel and using its fibonacci retracements (marked in blue) to determine the possible targets. Upper play Entry: 1.29656 TP: 1.30953, 1.32023, 1.33320 SL: 1.29042 -- Lower Play Entry: 1.28618 TP: 1.27613 SL: 1.28910 [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GBPUSD/LFPjz0BD-Decision-Point-on-GBPUSD-360-Pips/)

2) EURCHF:  I've never traded this pair, but I drew out the formation of the falling wedge quite a while ago and knew that the Euro's recent massive surge must have broken through it. This is a very interesting situation as it means that the price is trying to rally back to its recent maximum at 1.19 - and possibly even beyond that. The ones that have been following my ideas in the past will have noticed that I avoid trading the news so it wasn't a realistic idea to assume that the price would have broken through the way it did (we'd be gambling if we tried to trade the elections). However now that it has, I can see it hitting these 3 strong daily S&R levels with a bit of consolidation in between. The reason why this entry is a little higher than usual is because we can see a clear area of consolidation (marked by the blue rectangle ) where the price may experience a similar fate. If that area is cleared, then we can reasonably expect the aforementioned targets to be hit with ease. Setup Entry: 1.09031 SL: 1.08015 TP: 1.09749, 1.11050, 1.12054 [Graph](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EURCHF/oe9sgWgK-Breach-in-Falling-Wedge-on-EURCHF-300-pips/)

------

I really do appreciate all the kind words and support from a lot of people on the sub and I'm going to try and do these posts as much as I can, but sometimes I'm just waiting for pairs to show their hand so I can make a reasonable prediction. I feel like I've been on point more often than not, and forcing the ideas when they're not ready will almost certainly result in a dip in quality. That said, there are a lot of my older long-term ideas that are currently panning out (due to their nature) and unless you're going through my posts, some of you won't even get to see them so here are some of the older posts:

2391,2017-05-14,USD political risk and black swan event risk substantially increased.,"**Mainstream Consensus**

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/12/us-rises-to-the-top-of-the-list-of-markets-with-big-political-risk.html
> Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategist at UBS, said the market has been pricing improved earnings but also the expectations of better growth due to tax reform, stimulus and other pro-growth policy. He says political risk is not all that uncommon in the U.S., but now market expectations are high that there will be action.  

> Investors had been pricing in an 80 to 85 percent chance of some tax reform this year, but that has fallen. ""We now think they're pricing the likelihood of tax reform is on the order of 55 to 65 percent and they think it could be late 2017 or early 2018"" 

Much of the USD bull run was predicated on the promises regarding taxation reform. Recent bearish momentum against the USD was widely held to be 'correction'/'retracement', rather than reflecting a change in the underlying conditions. One would thus expect failure of the emergence, or even delay of tax reform to produce a rebalancing of USD exposure to the downside.

**Outside black-swan risk**

Two 'fringe' twitter commentators have risen to the attention of US political observers of late. Whilst they are at best still considered extremely controversial bordering on lunatic fringe, they have correctly and accurately called a variety of significant developments, indicating that they have at least some semi-reliable  sources.

Their most recent assertion is *extremely* out of the box, but that is why it should be considered under the black swan category: very low conventional-wisdom probability chance, but highly significant event. 

https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/14/exclusive-sealed-indictment-granted-against-donald-trump/

Note: the existence of a sealed indictment against Trump doesn't mean what many anti-Trump people might hope, given that impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. However, if their other claims about RICO cases against Pence and Ryan also prove to have legs, then the political climate will certainly be very different from the current one. Weak evidence to support this is that Claude Taylor's source did inform him of the presence of both the Grand Juries and the subsequent FBI subpoenas a week before the [mainstream media picked up on the story](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/grand-jury-fbi-russia/index.html). Also worth noting is that impeachment proceedings themselves won't necessarily result in impeachment in any case, but what we're interested in here is the initial market shock to the emergence of news like this in  mainstream channels, not the partisan aspects.

Again, I'm not claiming that any of this is likely, that's the *entire point* of it being a black-swan risk!!

EURUSD: On the higher timeframes, a bearish Bat pattern has completed but I still have a bullish view on the pair. I'm looking for price to hit election highs. Will be looking for a simple trend continuation trade, with price possibly retesting the highs of the previous swing.

GBPUSD: Bearish on this one. Price currently sits around the 1.30000 even handle, a very psychological level for many traders. Before markets opened, was looking for a short opportunity because of a potential double top. Price didn't get a chance to retest the highs, but fell about 40 pips when markets opened. Consolidated for a bit and formed a bearish Cypher pattern, however I'm still looking for a retest of the highs before potentially going short, depending on my rules.

2432,2017-06-14,Forex Secrets of the Banks,"FOREX TRADING STRATEGIES

  Both technicals and fundamentals are necessary to maximise consistent gains in trading in the long run. This is what many professionals do. The following were trades I made recently or are opportunities based on fundamentals and market sentiment.The blog on forex trading strategies will be published at least once a week. Fundamentals revealed through historical and real-time news are key and deserve more attention by traders despite the effort needed. This will pay off with a greater certitude in entering and exiting the markets when forex trading. I used to watch my trades continually with fear and trepidation. Now, I watch them knowing where and why they could move in a certain direction. It takes a while to learn the fundamentals and sentiment of currencies but it's well worth it because it works.
 
On Friday, June 2nd, 2017, the Non-Farm Employment Change was released. This is the official net number of U.S. jobs that were created in the month of May. It was expected at 181K  but came in at 138K, quite a drop. This number has the possibility of affecting future interest rate decisions by the Fed. It is still expected that the Fed will increase rates during their June meeting but future hikes could now be put on hold because of this number. The job participation rate also decreased, another negative factor for future rate hikes. This all indicated at least a temporary fall in the U.S. dollar. I coupled some of this weak dollar info with the fact that the markets seem to be anticipating the ECB to be changing their policy in turning off their printing presses soon, this indicated a stronger Euro. I placed a long EUR/USD trade for 12 pips, far shorter than it actually went. If I had noticed the info in the participation rate dropping earlier, I would have stayed in longer. I wasn't convinced at the time of a continued move. ",0,0.5

I predicted over 10s of profitable trades on FXStreet and Wave59.,"My short bio: I run a website about predictions on the market turns in FX, Bitcoin, Indexes and more.  I wrote books that predicted the exact day of the Gold market rebound & the start of the big bear market of Corn in 2014, and many profitable EURO intraday and swing trades, an epic EUR/USD trade profiting 800+ pips in 2015.

Why I choose to run an AMA:  
Brexit caught 98% of the market traders in surprise, but not to my subscribers.  I ‘forewarned’ them Dow would drop 1,000+ index points 2 weeks before it happened. It was a huge win for me, and I received many trading related questions from my customers how to predict the market turns after that.

That said, with the EUR/JPY and EUR/USD: the former has been riding the 20 day EMA as it rises into its narrowing wedge. Due to the uptrend, I know it's best to wait for a short confirmation, like crashing through supports, etc., but do we see a double top on the hourly? Prices have dropped with new lower lows and lower highs, and the bearish plummets were only answered with bullish retracements thus far. If it falls below its 20 day, is this a reversal in all of your opinion?

The EUR/USD Shows a similar pattern, but it is in a much stronger uptrend overall, and could just be a pull back from overextension.

2466,2017-08-07,Thoughts on USDJPY and Metals,"This week is dollar Stronk.  Everyone is talking about increasing Dollar strength secondary to inflation.  There is a ""widening of the interest rate differential between U.S. Government Bonds and Japanese Government Bonds""; as well, there is an increasing demand for higher risk assets... which straight forward means that money will move *away* from metals and *away* from the Yen, both of which are seen as safe havens in tough times.   

Metals are correlated to the JPY (Japanese Yen), gold more than silver, but both tend to follow the currency quite nicely. Yen up = metals up, and Yen down = metals down, almost to a T. Gold follows this almost rigidly, it is spooky how gold will mirror JPY almost to a tick. Now, most FX traders look at USDJPY... which means that when USDJPY drops, that means Yen is going up, which means metals should climb. Hence, metals are inversely correlated to USDJPY.

Take a look at these two articles:

https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/usdjpy-fundamental-weekly-forecast-its-all-about-u-s-inflation-this-week-427595

Really solid discussion within of the fundamentals that show that a USDJPY long is likely a good choice for the week.  As well: USDJPY produced a doji on the W1 chart, a decent reversal signal when correlated with other data. *Higher time-frames produce stronger signals, and algos have more money and power than you ever will, trader..... and those AIs respect these levels very much.* Check it out: https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/usd-jpy-forecast-bullish-follow-through-likely-after-last-weeks-doji-201708070413

This to me screams both long USDJPY as well as short metals (in whatever capacity you choose).

2469,2017-08-08,8th failed vote of no confidence of South African President Zuma. Profiting from the dancing,"I thought I'd bring up something that happened today and an outline of my actions. The vote of no confidence for President Zuma were to be casted in secret. After watching (on bloomberg and reuters live fb stream) a lot of the speeches by the ministers in parliament from all sides and the ensuing passionate love or hate for the ANC leader, I was waiting for the result. 

Commentators gave 25% chance that he might go. I also figured it was unlikely but I'd play for Zuma to go and place my stop losses at the ready for the announcement to go the expected way, and if by some chance 50 ANC mps vote him out then my profits would be delightful. 

Anyway, before the votes were counted the speaker of the house demanded mps avoid doing anything whatsoever that may giveaway the result before her announcement. 

After maybe 30 minutes of counting mps  started to gather again around their seats, and I started noticing before they had finished the count some opposition members' body language looking slightly glum, and ANC members the opposite. I began closing all my short EUR/ZAR &USD/ZAR positions as the market began to warm up. And then I start to see an ANC member clapping in the corner of the room, and soon there were 2 then 3, dancing and clapping. I went to my forex to place big long positions on EUR And USD despite the spreads. I come back to the stream and theres like 10 or more ANC dancing and clapping. At this point I'm already in profit as the ZAR weakens. After a few minutes, they pack up the votes and hand it to the speaker. She tells everyone to shut up. Announces Zuma will remain. And the ZAR weakens further. 

I've closed a couple of the long positions I had. Waiting to close my bigger ones and consolidate my profits. Worried it might drop after the initial peak today. 

TLDR - if you ever want to forecast a vote of no confidence in SA. Just wait for the dancing and clapping to give away the result.",17,1.0

2472,2017-08-11,My first 19 days of trading!,"First, I want to thank all the individuals that help me on this sub-reddit. I've come across many other trading groups but this has been the most memorable. I've been trading for about 2-3 months now but, it was strictly penny-stocks the USA Market. I learned a lot there but I seemed to fail every time. I didn't know anything about Forex until a mechanic introduced me to babypips. From there I began to learn the trade. For about 2-3 weeks straight I studied what the website could give me. But, I knew i couldn't learn everything from there. My father still tells me ""Birds of common feather, flock together."" so i went out to find a group of forex traders. About half way in I thought to myself, all the forex traders probably live in super foreign countries on high level platforms that i would never gain access to unless I was born in the ""Circle"". But then one day while i was looking at $SNAP memes and /r/wallstreetbets I thought to myself, ""Why not look in Reddit?"". And sure enough I found this group. I read though a bunch of the hot post and knew that this was the place. So I asked questions, learned things and tried to fit in. So in comes the trading. I've been using TD Ameritrade since I started so that's the platform I've been using. Since I graduated high-school last year and only had one job, I knew that I would have to start with the minimum amount. So I opened up a Demo account and put $2,000 in. I have to say the first few days were more of luck than skill. I went in with a penny-stock mind set. My first few trades were max 1,000 units. So when I did good I got pennies but when I did bad vice-versa(Not Vice-Versa but you know what I mean). Then I learned about margins and, ooh boy let me tell you. All my trades increased to standard lots(100,000u). And i was losing left and right. And then one would be super good. The good one was, a little bit of my knowledge and lot of a fundamental event happening and me not knowing about it. So I road it and got to about $200 Dollars of it. I forgot how much I put into it but, I was hooked. I was running around my room wondering why didn't i try this before! Then the next day came and I lost $500 dollars. I was about to call it quits when, I went thought the subreddit again and saw that the real thing that makes a trader the will power and stubbornness not to give up and to recover from failures. So I buckled up and said lets do this. Everyday I drove to work I'd listen to a Forex podcast. When I got home instead of playing World of Warcraft or spending money on steam for games, I'd sit and look at the charts and learn how to use indicators and how they work. Then I jumped back into the market and began trading. I was still using crazy units but every now and then I'd make a breakthrough. One day I'd make $200-$300 dollars and in the same day lose 90-100% of it. It wasn't until /u/SanDiegoMAGApede (Prob tired of me linking them) commented on one of my post that I began to learn risk management. Then the game was on. My trades were becoming more efficient and my days became more green. I was scalping for the majority of it until I started to see trends in the market. It was about two days ago, I was trading for ten hours straight 7-4pm(Currently getting ready for college so the weekdays are all free to me for a little bit) that i made my first real break though. I saw a trend coming and acted on it. And to my surprise it worked! I got a nice 30-40 pips. Then I longed and got a 10-20 pip gain. Then shorted for a another 30-40 pip gain. (USD/CAD). I was shocked! The next day I tried to do it again and... well lets say I wasn't a happy trader.. Then today came. I've asked questions about Fundamentals here because, one time an event caught me off guard and I lost a lot. So today came and I said to myself ""lets trade on this news."" I jumped on Forex Factory, set about a dollars worth of Yen on notifications to my phone and waited. It was the longest 5 minutes  in my life my heart was racing super fast and then it came.. and I was right!. I road the EUR/USD train all the way to the top and sold. Then I shorted and rode about half way before I went to work and closed. I was almost at $2,900 in my account I was trading on my phone on the way to work (as a passenger) which wasn't a good idea because I lost about $100+. I'm a server in a sports bar so work looked like a weekend in the markets. I then decided to go into a party room and start to trade again. I was so close to reaching my goal ($3,000 BP). So for a few hours I traded EUR/USD and I then a table came and I left for about 4-5 hours. Got my $17 from work bought a salad and jumped on EUR/USD. I was at $2,958 I was eyes on the market. I saw a fighting box(IDK what to call it) and started scalping the living hell out of it. Eventually I made it to $3,001.15. I started to run around the restaurant and jump around. My manger was worried and told me I was scaring him so I calmed down, jump on the phone with my father and was we were both stoked. Here's the link to day one to today: http://imgur.com/j06ycgB .

2506,2017-08-25,Improve your Trading Immediately With Currency Indices,"Here's a little tip that's helped me immensely with my trading :

One of the best things to do is to identify where relative strength and weakness lies amongst the different currency pairs. There are several ways of doing this. One of my favourite methods is to do my technical analysis and chart work of the major currency indices I follow. 

So here are the indices and their respective symbols
Aussie Dollar: AXY
British Pound:BXY
Canadian dollar :CXY
US dollar: DXY
Euro: EXY
Japanese Yen: JXY
New Zealand Dollar: ZXY

Looking at these indices on a longer time frame you can easily determine if a currency has upside, downside, or is choppy and relatively flat. 

The idea is that you match your analysis of a currency that is showing strength and pair it against a currency that is in a downtrend to have an idea of what pairs to be trading on a short, medium, or long term basis. 

In my experience this sort of analysis works best on a medium to long term timeframe. 

So here's a real world example. If you look at the Euro, it's the clear out performer this month whereas the Kiwi was underperforming. And indeed if you look at EURNZD it becomes obvious that buying the Euro and shorting the Kiwi was the right move to make all month long.

Well it only took 9 years but the FED is finally winding down QE on top of raising rates. 

Will trigger another recession? 

YES and NO. This policy has effectively been a safety net, or as Peter Schiff calls them ""Training Wheels"". 

Simply put, removing QE is going to force the economy to sustain itself on its own and there is going to be a correction. Which means a weaker dollar. 

Also rising interest rates are going to happen which will trigger rising mortgage payments in ARM loans just like in 2008

http://www.themreport.com/daily-dose/01-08-2017/arm-market-share-ready-rise

And every 0.25% the Fed increases rates the more likely homes are to foreclosed. There are roughly around 5.5 million ARM Mortgages in the USA today. If 20% failed (1 million mortgages) that could mean disaster again, (easier to happen than you think, could the poorest 20% of those 5.5 million default if their mortgage went up $1000 bucks??? HELL YEAH) 

1 million mortgages multiplied by $100,000 = 1 Trillion dollars! 

It aint no small matter either. 

Not to mention that Mortgage back securities still exist, Yeah remember those? The ones that helped cause the crash? Yeah they just changed the name and nothing changed. I have been hearing a lot of commercials trying to help people get mortgages with bad credit. 

#IF THERE WAS EVER A RED FLAG SIGNAL FOR A MARKET THAT IS IT

My estimate is 6 months after the fed funds rate hits around 4% is when you will start to see big foreclosures **again**. Imagine your mortgage going up $500 to $1000 or even $2000 from origination. 

This plus the end of QE and a Federal gov that does not have a balanced budget, we can expect some craziness ahead. 

Mainly this is going to be a ""Scary"" time since many of the life support systems that were put in place in 2008/9 are slowly being turned off. 

In the end, I am bearish on the dollar from around 2019/2020 Once fully implemented. However if they stay the course and dont freak out I think the dollar will come roaring back as the economy actually stabilzes without gov intervention probably around 2021/22.

Heres my guide to fundamental analysis.,"I see so many questions relating to ""How do Hedge Fund/Investment Banks/Trading Firms trade?"". While most people on r/Forex have no idea, they like to tell people their two cents. Top funds/banks/traders do not use technical analysis as they are solely a derivative of price. They use Fundamental analysis and leading indicators such as Volume. Be warned, the following is not for the faint-hearted and requires some (albeit basic) economic understanding. However, this might demystify fundamental analysis for you. If you can understand what I'm saying here, you are doing better than 90% of most retail traders. Enjoy. 


#1.	Explain how factors that affect the demand for a currency, or the supply of a currency, affect the determination of an equilibrium exchange rate.

•	In a floating exchange rate regime, the exchange rate is determined by the demand for and supply of a currency.

•	The demand for a currency is represented by a downward-sloping demand curve. A lower exchange rate will increase the competitiveness of a country’s exports, thus attracting buyers of the local currency in order to purchase those goods, services, and financial assets.

•	The supply of a currency is represented by an upward-sloping demand curve. As the local currency appreciates, the relative cost of foreign currencies falls, thus attracting sellers of the local currencies (i.e. buyers of the foreign currency).

•	The equilibrium exchange rate is at the intersection of the demand and supply curves. In an efficient market, any other exchange rate would result in an increase in either demand or supply, thus maintaining the equilibrium exchange rate.

•	A country that maintains a linked exchange rate, crawling peg or managed float exchange rate regime, whereby the local currency is tied to another currency such as the USD, or a basket of other currencies, is effectively tied into supply and demand factors that affect the currency or the basket of currencies to which it is linked or pegged.

#2.	Understand how the major factors that influence exchange rate movements operate, particularly:


a.	Relative inflation rates

•	Of the theories advanced to explain the exchange rate, and changes in the equilibrium rate, the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory is the longest standing.

•	PPP theory contends that movements in exchange rates will ensure that the cost of identical goods and services will be equal across countries. A change in inflation represents a change in prices in a country; PPP argues that a change in relative inflation rates between countries will be offset by a change in the exchange rate.

•	Under PPP, a country with a higher inflation rate relative to another country can expect its currency to depreciate.

•	Perhaps the most critical shortcoming of PPP is that there are variables in addition to inflation that affects the value of a currency.

•	PPP calculations that apply inflation differentials between two countries can be used to determine the expected change in the exchange rate.


b.	Relative national income growth rates

•	Changes in relative national income growth rates also affect an exchange rate. For example, increased national income will typically result in increased imports and therefore an increase in the supply of the local currency on the FX markets. However, in a dynamic market, increased national income might encourage business growth, with associated local and overseas investment. This will also have an impact on demand and supply factors in the FX markets.

•	An increase in the relative rate of growth is likely to result in an increased demand for imports, which will result in a depreciation of the currency.

•	On the other hand, an increase in the growth rate may also result in an increase in foreign investment inflows, which will cause the currency to appreciate.

•	Both the above mechanisms are likely to operate, with the balance between the two changing from time to time.


c.	Relative interest rates

•	Relative interest rates also affect an exchange rate. For example, a relative increase in local interest rates will attract overseas investors; these investors will purchase the local currency and sell their own currency. Investors need to consider interest rate differentials in conjunction with forecast changes in the exchange rate. Future exchange rate changes will affect the value of future cash flows associated with international investments.

•	It is important to determine whether the change in interest rates are due to inflationary expectations, or a change in the real rate of interest.

•	If the increase in interest rates is a result of an increase in inflation expectations, a currency should depreciate. However, if the increase is due to a rise in the real rate of interest, then the currency should appreciate.


d.	Exchange rate expectations

•	In addition to the economic fundamentals, exchange rate expectations are important in determining the FX value of a currency.

•	Exchange rate expectations have a strong influence on exchange rates. Market participants analyse new information in order to try and forecast future impacts on an exchange rate. It may be possible to adopt a specific market indicator as a proxy for exchange rate expectations. For example, in Australia, the commodity price index is often used as a proxy. If sufficient participants form a view, the exchange rate will move; speculators play a large role in forming exchange rate expectations.

•	The modelling of expectations is a particularly difficult task. Theoretically, expectations should be formed on the basis of the expected values of economic fundamentals. However, the FX market often reacts to new information before the impact on the longer-term economic fundamentals is fully analysed.


e.	Central bank or government intervention

•	The actions of governments or central banks are another variable that may be important in the FX markets.

•	The monetary policy setting of a central bank will impact upon the demand and supply factors that affect an exchange rate. Also, a central bank or government may intervene in the FX markets to influence directly the level of an exchange rate by intervening in international trade flows, intervening in foreign investment flows or conducting FX transactions in the markets.

•	For example, in an attempt to increase the FX value of its currency, a central bank may sell foreign currency and buy the local currency; alternatively, to reduce the value of its currency, the central bank may buy foreign currency. Alternatively, a government may implement policies that change tariff, quota or embargo settings relating to goods and services.

#3.	Explore regression analysis as a statistical technique applied to variables that impact on an exchange rate.


•	Regression analysis is a quantitative method that measures how movements in variables impact on another variable.

•	A regression model that measures percentage changes in an exchange rate should include variables of relative inflation rates, relative national income growth, relative interest rates, government or central bank invention and exchange rate expectations.

•	The model will calculate regression coefficients that measure the responsiveness of the exchange rate to a particular variable.

•	A dummy variable may be used for variables that do not have a data set (e.g. government intervention). A value of one would be assigned to periods where intervention occurred and the value zero to non-intervention periods. An indication of periods when central bank intervention occurs may be changes in the central bank’s holding of local and foreign currency reserves.

Price was able to hold the 23.6% retracement and we were able to break the high of the previous week. Looks like price might want to retest the highs again. 


Daily Chart- https://www.tradingview.com/x/7PBqLQqA/


Price has entered a very strong inflection zone and has hit the monthly pivot point , which also coincides with the 61% retracement from the daily swing high on Sept.20. The confluence of resistance might see price pushed back to retest the low 1700s. 


H4- https://www.tradingview.com/x/f5V0PCCG


Price looks like its being rejected by a descending trend-line from early September. Lots of resistance here, definitely looks bearish . 

I am currently in a short position entered at 1.1850 

Target is 1.1700 

Stop-loss at 1.1910 

If price continues to climb this coming week and breaks through 1.1900 then I believe we will see a re-test of the market highs. I will wait and look to establish a short position at the highs.

2585,2017-10-16,Help me understand hedging in forex.,"I’ve been thinking about developing a long-term trend/carry trade strategy. The strategy might be long both USD/JPY and AUD/USD with the same position size (in USD), creating a net 0 position in USD. This would hedge both positions against changes in the value of USD, making their value dependent on only the foreign currencies themselves. Wouldn’t this allow you to use way more leverage because less of your account is used as margin for holding USD? Am I understanding this correctly? It seems to be of strategic value. Also, is this kind of hedging even allowed with retail fx brokers?

I've been trading oil for years, I'm a big technical / news trader on it, and I primarily only trade oil and a one or two major pairs. 

Crude is testing the $55 mark currently, along with futures playing with the $60 mark. With Russia / Saudi pre-confirming that the want to extend the OPEC production cut, and several other countries confirming that they will be staying on board.

How do you guys see this testing band going? We're testing levels from January 2017 / March 2015. Oil prices haven't been seen this high since those time frames, and when it peaked this rate back in March 2015, it was followed by a steep crash. Though I'm not certain of the news related articles back at that time period as I haven't looked into it.

I'm currently up 90,000 USD in the last week from this lovely oil increase, from trading under $52 last week to now trading at the $55 mark, though I'm refraining from trading at this resistance point as I'm not quite sure how this is going to pan out.

flow, 64.1% of USD/JPY and 61.7% of EUR/JPY

compare this to:

>The proportion of flow in GBP/JPY was wild – with non-bank participants in one hour responsible for 96% of flow and in another,
just 9%.  

That non-bank participants should completely dominate flows for that cross seems notable. 

One contributing factor is highlighted earlier in the paper.

> The non-bank proportion rose in EUR/GBP and EUR/JPY, but could be because the data suggest the non-banks are more
active in crosses than the “legs”. Several of these firms construct a price in the cross using the legs and **because their technology
is often nimbler and quicker, they are top of book in the more complex pairs**.

(Emphasis mine)

What does all this mean for your trading? 

For most people, it means nothing at all, as most retail traders get no further than the chart as printed and a series of set criteria.

For traders who work with market feel, or the lower timeframes, it raises some interesting question about whether or not non-bank liquidity *feels* different from bank dominated markets. 

Non-bank liquidity providers are certainly working with a different agenda, different tech, and different liquidity networks from banks. And whilst not necessarily behaving unethically, they are also less likely to have a prudential-oriented client focus - banks in theory are trying to get best price for clients without disrupting the market, non-bank actors don't necessarily operate by these principles.

 They also are more likely to operate with different risk parameters - high turnover, 'hot potato' providers have less depth of pocket than banks, so perhaps there might be more churn and candle-wick-y-ness, especially on thinner liquidity networks.

This is very subjective, and speculative, of course, but that is the nature of the way some of us play the game!

2653,2017-11-24,Predicting XAG USD using Facebook's Prophet library,"Hi guys! Facebook recently (mid year actually) released an open source library to predict time series, called Prophet. https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/

I am not a professional trader(on the contrary pretty awful at it) but I thought that it would be interesting to test it by trying to predict this year's Silver prices. Prophet works best with daily data and so the predictions were made for every month. I used a very basic form of time-based stop loss(almost non-existent) at the end of the month in case the take profits were not triggered  But in the end the results showed a 4.9% profit in one year you could say(predicted and validated 10 months, couldn't validate for December of course since we are in November).

The blog post is at http://therandomtechadventure.blogspot.com/2017/11/backtesting-xagusd-silver-price.html
and the source code is available at https://github.com/Lougarou/backtestfbprophet

Do you think Facebook's Prophet has any merit as a market predictor?

2661,2017-11-28,"My experience with ""Lazy"" Forex'ing","Cliffnotes: I spent a year (11 months) trading once a day, 1:2 rr, no analysis, and I ended my trading year last week at +60%. Yes, you can call me a gambler rather than a trader if you want. Yes, I know, this is basically just a daily breakout strategy. I realized that after the fact – there really isn’t much that’s new in the world.

I've lurked here for a couple years but I'm not big on Reddit. I posted this last week but since it’s a new account the post was auto-deleted. I thought I'd share my 2017 results as it's the first time I saw something through to the end. I enjoy FX but I quickly lost interest in reading charts due to quite a few reasons, but mainly because it was too time consuming for me and I don't have access to open trades for most of the day so I would try to force trades when I was in front of the computer. I basically want my cake and to eat it too. I want to be ""in the market"", with little to none of the analysis, so I changed how I was looking at it. Instead of trying to read S/R and price action I looked at it in a ""if X happens, how often does Y happen"" way. As soon as I found something frequently enough, I tried to build a trade out of it. I started looking at the market as gambling that I could put in my favor rather than something I could read.

Sometime in 2016 I got a ""same trade every day"" idea in my head and couldn't shake it. Long story somewhat shorter, I spent a boatload of hours looking at 2016 AUD/USD ranges. I forget the exact numbers now, but I remember my initial targets were 25p tp/ 8p sl. I started trading this in December of 2016 but I realized I was being too aggressive with a 1:3 with such a tight stop and this was changed mid-January to a flat 10p sl/20p tp. I then withdrew everything except $1000 from my account and told myself I wouldn't change the amount or my sl/tp for 6 months. SL is always 2% @ 10 pips, TP is always 4% @ 20 pips, and I only traded this on AU.

I opened two stop orders with a 10p stop and a 20p tp at the high and low of the previous day off of the 15m chart (not on Sundays). If one got triggered I closed the other one - or tried to. There were days where I wasn't around to see the notification and both trades got activated for a loss. There were also a couple days where both trades hit their TP and I came home to an 8% win. That was nice.

Anyways, I did miss a few days here and there, I made a few mistakes along the way as well like moving my SL to break even before work, only to get knocked our early. To be honest, I did this more than a couple times before I stopped myself. It saved me quite a few losses, but it cost me some winners too, and most importantly, it wasn't something I was ""supposed"" to be doing. I won a few bigger trades that I shouldn't have by moving my TP and lost trades I shouldn't have even been in. Eventually though, I got to the point of just leaving it.

Takeaways:

Worst month was -15%. Something like -$230...I think I lost like 9-10 days in a row. This sucked. It wasn’t fun. At all. Opening the trades at one point was something I actually hated doing and just assumed I was throwing $30 away and would either wake up or come home to red numbers.

Lowest the account ever was: 919.10. This was at the end of Jan/early Feb and I was convinced I was just throwing money away like a dumbass at that point. 

Best month was +21% at around +$240.

Highest the account ever was: 1,808.40

Final: 1579.35

I may stay away from trading holidays next year. I'm glad I stopped last week for sure at least since thanksgiving would have also been bad. I'm also not a mathematician or a statistician. It's very possible, if not flat-out likely that my sl/tp could have been optimized better. I'm just telling you what I did this year.

I am going to diversify next year. I'm going to apply the same trading style to 3 other currency pairs I’m looking at and change the rr to .75/1.5 so I’m risking just over 3%/day, but spread out more. I'm also going to increase my account size to $2500. If this works for 2 years in a row then I'll probably go big around this time next year.

This might piss some real, chart-reading traders off, and I may have another good year next year or I may just blow the account on 4 bad currencies. What I learned though, is that if you find something that happens at even a marginally higher than average rate, and apply proper risk management, you’ll probably be ok in the end. Regardless, I stuck with something through good and bad for an entire year and even though it wasn’t with much money I'm happy with myself for it.

2662,2017-11-28,GBP/USD perfect bearish setup and unexpected move,"So there was this perfect bearish setup in GBPUSD where price had just reached a major resistance level, yesterday price closed with a perfect shooting star in daily chart, and two bearish engulfing patterns appeared in H4, completing a head&shoulders pattern in H1.

Indeed, price dropped down the expected amount of pips, but suddenly it fired up like crazy until reaching again the top of the h&s pattern. Now is starting to drop quite strongly.

I want to know what has been the reason for this crazy upwards movement after the bearish reversal. Initially I thought it would've been some recent news I didn't know about, but now I'm thinking it maybe was some nasty play from the institutional traders to kick out of the market all the unwary traders before definitely heading down.

The EURUSD had little movement yesterday, and managed to form a bit if a shooting star. Having enough support at the 1.18 level, it will eventually go higher, evenso if the tax bill comes in play and weakens the dollar further. We shouldn’t worry about going under 1.18, but if it happens, at 1.17 the pair will find buyers s it us a massive support.
The GBPUSD has rallied significantly, breaking above the previous hammer and shooting star, which is a very bullish sign. We are heading to 1.35 level, and possibly closing the Brexit gap to 1.365. Expect pull-backs to 1.333, but it is a buy only market at this point.
The USDJPY has rolled over, but kept itself above 112. It also shows a very bullish market, but could form a shooting star which is  a negative sign and can drop the pair to 108. We have to note, that the 50% fibonacci retracement can keep it above 111, helping to find buyers in that area.

Goldman Sachs will take $5B in earnings charges attributable to the US tax overhaul. Goldman says two-thirds of the charge stems from a repatriation tax it will pay on cash it is bringing back from overseas operations. (That tax is actually lower under the new system, but the reduction encourages companies to repatriate cash they might otherwise have left abroad.) Goldman is also taking an unspecified write-down of its deferred tax assets, which are past losses that can be used to defray future tax bills. Many banks that had near-death experiences during the crisis--Bank of America has more than $19B of them in its pocket--will have to write down these credits, which are now worth less after the tax overhaul reduced the headline corporate tax from 35% to 21%

What's the difference between using leverage 100:1 and 500:1?
With 100:1 leverage I buy 1 EURUSD lot (100k) and my used margin is 1,000 USD. With 500:1 leverage when buying the same 1 lot my used margin is 200 USD. In both cases I set a stop loss at 100 pips which is 100 USD (1 USD per pip) which is 2% of my equity. So basically the higher leverage does not increase my risk (apart that I can place more orders with a higher leverage)? Am I missing some point here? Please explain. ",8,0.79

I haven't jumped the gun yet on trading live and had a couple questions on currency conversion and how brokers handle it. I plan on trading with Oanda.

1) If my account is using a base balance of CAD and I want to trade EUR/USD, when I close a position will my broker automatically add/subtract my profit/loss to my account using my accounts base currency at the current exchange rate? If I'm using leverage, will the loans automatically close after a position has been closed?

2) I'm trying to write some automated back tests and realize that in order to correctly calculate my risk per trade at a given point in time, I need historical exchange rates. What APIs are typically used for this? One I've come across is fixer.io. I've noticed that Oanda has one, but it looks rather pricey.

I have been working on this version solidly for over a month. I believe I have finally cracked it. So here it is, The fully automated IG Index trading program. 

I have been skeptical about my own results. However, **I can confirm that it has doubled my money in a week.** This is set to trade on the **GBP/USD** but it can be changed to work on anything (With as little as one tiny line of code). However, I am giving you this for free so if you want to use it on something else feel free to change the code. I am confident the algo would work the same. 

I have tested this in live for an entire week straight and not one trade in a(40 out of 40). I experienced onewhen the website went down but that was my choice to close the trade because I was more than in profit and wanted to fix the error. I have added a loop to check the HTTP 200 OK status so that should not happen now even if the IG site goes down. It will simply gracefully wait until it is backup and resume itself. **Other than that, there was no human interaction** 

Granted, there are parts of the code that are hacky af. However, that said it is robust enough to run on a live account. I have tested it personally. **Please take extra caution to review the code and make sure it fits your own trading style.** 

Thank you to a few math/python people from over the internet. Stack-overflow etc. I present to you...

They take other people's opinion as confirmation when they should be looking at price. 

Questions like ""Is GBP/AUD a buy?"" when the pair is ranging. I can't predict the future, if I could I would be VERY rich. Before buying or selling look at price in different timeframes as confirmation. If the pair is ranging its never a good idea to buy, unless you see a lot of momentum to the upside. 

Price action is the king before all indicators. Some indicators may FORECAST a buy, but you should always wait for confirmation on multiple time frames, if there are any upcoming important news, and not less important the TIME of the day. ",25,0.85

I feel like this latest commit has all the features I want now. There are lot more ideas swirling round in my head. 

If you have not heard of FAIG before or thinking what the hell is FAIG (Fully Automated IG) then basically it is a brain child of mine to automate my trades on IG Index using Python (3) and the REST API, IG Index is one if not the most popular Spread Betting provider here in the UK and I am sure abroad. 

Most of you I have had to respond to but it is getting a bit full on now, So I am releasing this thread. Most questions have been answered now the fun bit... Testing and making some money. 

This week has been exceptional for me in terms of results. Another week where I have effectively doubled my money. So, onto the important stuff. 

* Decreased the number of API calls made, this was an important one. I have cut down the number of API calls to improve efficiency and stay under the limits.
* Bit of code refactoring for my own sanity, A lot more to do. 
* Internal logic of trading stays the same but with a few extra safe guards and using the TR/ATR to figure out a better stopposition and a better limit also. 
* Code to get out of a trade that has been going on far too long, this was an issue before where some trades would close in seconds some would take over 15 hours. This latest push hopefully remedy is this. 

Please trade responsibly, Test, Test and more test and report back to me. 

I get asked this ALOT....**If you get a CST error it is most likely an API key issue.** 

Whilst this code is fully functioning I cannot guarantee the existence of bugs in it. It is still in beta now but it works. 

This is set to trade on two instruments (One trade at a time though still) EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Because of time zones and such like you might get better results with one than other but I think that over time it should make for some better trading positions.

2793,2018-01-25,"Market report 1/25/18: JPY, MXN","Yesterday was a good day to short the USD. I had issues with my trade execution I need to correct, but I've got some decent positions backed by break-even SLs that I'm hoping will bear fruit going forward. The big thing I learned was the power of waiting for news. During news it's important to make bigger plays rather than small ones. For some reason, I had that backwards! :-P

I'm still short USD, but I'm not convinced it's time to double-down yet. I'm expecting at least some consolidation before having to make a decision. I don't want to ruin my positions by adding now only to be stopped out because price reached the average of my two entries.

Today there was some negative news out of Mexico. Minor reports, but sales data is down. I'm expecting Mexico to fall off given the reports of crime coming out of there. No one I know here in the US wants to vacation there. That has to hurt their bottom line, so I'm long USDMXN for a very small play against the recent low 18.3 established 6am PST. If my broker offered anything other than USD against MXN I would take it. I tried to short USDMXN before and got burned, so like I say, very minor play here, especially considering the negative carry trade.

3:30pm PST today is the JPY announcement. No change in interest rates or core CPI are forecast. YoY inflation is projected higher, but MoM is lower. Overall it appears to be a non-event, other than it could perhaps project USDJPY lower.

I of course had a USDJPY position yesterday, but I got stopped out. Later in the day I [took a contrarian position to one of our forum members](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/7squlh/eurnzd_spiked_up_over_200_pips_in_just_a_minute/) and went short NZDJPY. It was an accident, on reflection AUDNZD was probably a better play. But now I have short NZDJPY and am also in a long EURJPY from before. I'm confident in my SL in both of these and don't anticipate the BoJ announcement is going to have an affect on these trades.

Instead what I'd like to do is watch closely how USDJPY reacts to the announcement. Whichever way it goes that's how I'm going to play it, with a SL above or below the 4-hour candle (since the announcement is at the start of a new daily).",7,0.99

* Oil is moving upwards and historically CAD has been closely tied to the movement of WTI.

2800,2018-01-27,Overview of the week of January 21st,"Hey everyone, so I figured that I would try something new to get this subreddit a bit more life. At the end of each work week I wanna create a post discussing everyone's best and worst trades. Seeing where we went right and where we went wrong and how to learn from our mistakes and others as well to minimize huge losses.

Biggest Gain- for me this week GBP/JPY was my best trading pair. I made 2 really good position trades back to back where I predicted both a selling point and buying point using support and resistance levels and made almost 100 pips per transaction.

Biggest Loss- this week I have to say the worst blunder I had was EUR/USD. I made a position trade using the same strategy as before and the Euro dipped low enough for my position to open and close at the stop loss in a matter of minutes. Granted when I do lose at the max it's 3% of my portfolio worth so it's not bad but with the this pair it happened most frequently.

Altogether last Monday is when I started with a dummy account and I have had good days and bad days but I started off with 460 dollars and in the first week made it up to 520, and this week I am up to over 600. My goal is to at least make 20% return each week until I hit over 1000 dollars before I consider going live. My lot sizes are roughly only 5000 units so the market can fluxuate a little if need be. With these trades I have been training to hone my swing trading skills I have learned using EMAs set with perioids of 30 and 50, Bollinger bands set at 20 with a deviation of 2, and swing trading strategies I have learned through forex and stock trading courses I bought on udemy.com

Trump: Speculation, you say? I know how to play that game. Let’s get the chart to draw one of those pin bar candles. That should be enough to get some speculators to start buying up dollars. Half that crap is automated now, if we draw one of those the computers will just start buying dollars. I know just who to call to help us here. Get Mnuchin on the phone.

Mnuchin: Hello?

Trump: Hey, buddy! Remember when you used to be a hedge fund manager? What were those things that used to get traders to change from bear to bull?

Mnuchin: Well, there’s several things that would cause a chart to look like a reversal technically. In a short period of time the pin bar candle is something traders would respect. The price just has to move down to set a new low then up over the course of a day. The bigger the move the more interest it would generate.

Trump: Hmm, how can we generate a big move?

Powell: Big moves in currency always come around rate announcements. Draghi is supposed to have one for the Euro on the 25th. They’ve been doing pretty good lately but no ones sure if they’re ever going to unwind their balance sheet.

Trump: Perfect! Let’s use that. Here’s what we’re going to do. Mnuchin, you’re going to have to play dumb and release a statement right before Draghi’s speech that we want a weak dollar. Draghi won’t know what hit him, so when it’s time to make his speech he will have to admit that the Euro is gaining too fast and talk about how it’s really not that strong. Then I’ll swoop in and say how I really want a strong dollar and Mnuchin made a mistake. If we time it right, it should make a perfect little pin on that DXY chart.

(At least this is what I hope happened)

2830,2018-02-14,EURUSD fundamental analysis 2/13/18,"So I pulled up the data from January 2017 on both Euro and USD. I think everyone can agree that was when you wanted to go long EURUSD. Here's what I found on each of the categories that I've been told are important to fundamental analysis:

* 17-Jan	euro	usd
* interest rate	0	0.75
* inflation rate	1.8	2.5
* gdp growth rate	0.6	1.2
* unemployment rate	9.6	4.8
* balance of trade	-1583	-48715
* government debt to GDP	90.3	105.8

Here's where we stand today:

* 18-Feb	euro	usd
* interest rate	0	1.5
* inflation rate	1.3	2.1
* gdp growth rate	0.6	2.6
* unemployment rate	8.7	4.1
* balance of trade	26273	-53118
* government debt to GDP	89.2	105.4

As I've noted before the big thing that stood out in the Jan 17 assessment is that negative trade balance on the US side. I still maintain that $48B/mo in negative cash flows (now $79B!) just from running the economy has to dwarf any contribution from Forex speculators, but maybe I'm wrong. Yes, trillions of dollars move through Forex and derivatives, but these are Euros being bought with no stop loss or take profit, and minimal concern for order entry position. We would have to go all the way back to May of 2014 to see conditions that greatly favored the US.

Comparing this year to last, Euro is down 28% on its inflation but up 9.4% on unemployment and 1.2% on government debt. The trade balance has swung $24.7B in favor of the Euro. GDP growth rate and interest rate has not changed.

On the other hand, the USD had doubled its interest rate while losing 16% of its inflation. GDP has more than doubled and unemployment has improved 14.6%. The massive trade deficit has worsened 9% to -$53B. Government debt improved last year 0.38% but I expect that number to worsen once Trump's tax plan is on the books.

Tomorrow's inflation data is projected to show 1.9% which would be even worse at -24%.

So going category by category:

* interest rate: favors US for the moment (see below)
* inflation: favors Euro
* GDP: greatly favors US
* unemployment: US
* BoT: greatly favors Euro
* Government debt: favors Euro, soon will even more heavily 

I'm not seeing inflation to justify interest rate increases on the USD side. If you want to buy bonds I think now is the time to do so. You can resell them later once the US announces it is backing off from interest rate increases. The Trump tax plan did prop up the stock market momentarily, but it also incurs debt that's going to hurt the US if it wants to continue raising interest rates.

The US cannot fix its trade balance. The new tax plan really only helps plutocrats. I don't think giving more money to the average citizen would help either since the average citizen would just spend more on foreign goods. The only thing I can think of is some sort of redistribution of wealth, with a focus on helping small businesses. At any rate, I'm not a politician just a speculative spectator.

Other than long EURUSD, JPY, ZAR, and CNH all look strong with high trade balances to counteract the USD. ZAR and CNH have higher interest rates, though Oanda doesn't pay interest on the CNH trade. NZD looks more risky but it might be worth a play as well. There isn't as much pressure for them to drive their currency down like there is for JPY and CNH. I like ZAR mostly as a hedge against the negative carry trade from being long the other currencies, but it should improve in value as well.",16,0.92

I start with realistic deposit (for me) of 500 USD with 1:100 leverage, I trade only 0.05 lots, and I either end up losing it all or floating around that number the entire time I’m practicing. I keep telling myself that even if I’m losing I need to make the best of my situations, and sometimes I do well, but the majority of the time I’m not and it’s extremely discouraging.

Wednesday night into Thursday, February 22

How about that FOMC? I am going to put up a separate FOMC thread, but basically we had a big event today, and I think the market is ready to tell us where it wants to go now.  USD talks, its the big dog in the room, and after January's sell off, many have been looking for further indications of where the market wants to go.  Hopefully today provided some of that. 

We are always advocates of *not* playing binary/high volatility events in the world of FX. For those of you who are new, take a look at your charts, and you are seeing why you shouldn't hold through these things.  Here's an example, Take a look at this chart: 

https://i.imgur.com/jn7QGLL.png

That is the /6A M15 chart. The /6A is the AUD future, think of it as a leading AUD/USD chart.  See that bull spike?  That's algorithms and AIs reacting to the news.  Now, you may state ""I could have held short through this"", but considering the following outcomes:

* Even though you were ""right"" in this case, and the FOMC minutes showed bullishness on rate raising (which is good for the dollar), you still face the risk of Stopout.  High volatility events can hit that stop loss - gets hit, almost every time.  Unless your stop is super wide, you face the risk of being stopped *even if you were right*. As well, you face the risk of whipsawing for several minutes.
* FOMC reverses off of what everyone expected, let's say they look non committal to rate raises, or the Fed appears to basically say ""we were wrong about inflation"", and the market craters as AIs/Algos, Banks, and Institutions flee the USD like rats off of a sinking ship.  You are suddenly massively negative, and have just paid a very large tuition for this valuable lesson.
* A third risk is that you have put in a limit buy in the opposite direction of a trade of yours in case your stop gets hit.... and the machines hit your stop, trip your limit buy, *then reverse like this chart did*, and you're double dipped. Ouch!

Hope no one got hurt today.

2850,2018-02-22,The big fat r/Forex FOMC Minutes and Dollar thread,"Let's talk FOMC and the USD.

> > FOMC Minutes

The short version is that after parsing through the language of the FOMC minutes, most analysts see a somewhat mixed to positive message:

* Some Fed officials see an ""appreciable risk"" that inflation remains below their 2% target, according to the minutes of their January meeting released on Wednesday.
* Wall Street has been focused on inflation since that meeting. Concerns about it — and higher interest rates — helped plunge the stock market into a correction.
* The Fed was otherwise upbeat on the economy, and expects tax cuts to support growth. [source](http://www.businessinsider.com/federal-reserve-minutes-fomc-january-meeting-2018-2)

Also

* FOMC members said they have revised upward the economic projections they made at the previous meeting in December.
* The January meeting was the last one for Chair Janet Yellen, who had guided the Fed through the first rate normalization steps a decade after the financial crisis.
* Markets already were on edge after the January Fed meeting, during which the committee said it expected that ""further gradual adjustments"" in monetary policy. [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/fed-minutes-all-signs-pointing-to-more-rate-hikes-ahead.html)

> > Why are the minutes important?

The key to understanding why FOMC is important this time comes from this statement:

* ""investors were reading them for more information on how FOMC members were thinking about inflation, and how much they could raise interest rates to combat it."" [source](http://www.businessinsider.com/federal-reserve-minutes-fomc-january-meeting-2018-2)

[Interest rates up means dollar up, it's that easy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101215/how-fed-fund-rate-hikes-affect-us-dollar.asp).  10 year rate hit 2.93% today, wow!

> >USD

Most targets, except for USDJPY due to it's correlation to SPX/SPY and DJI, are bullish.  I saw several small gap downs in futures which represent a strong opening for the USD.  USDCAD is looking to tear.  AUDUSD is potentially breaking a huge support line at .7800.

You aren't getting 100% guidance because ***that doesn't exist in FX***.  It's  anebvulous message.  There is likely other factors too:

* Fear that the market still needs to fill the gaps in it's shitty structure that was built during that insane Christmas/Post-Christmas bull charge
* Fear of the new Fed Chair: who is he? What is he like?  Another dove like Yellen, unpredictable like Bernanke?
* Fear that the Fed may not have as much power as they say they do?  So much wealth has been generated within private sector that it is becoming apparent that the Fed doesn't have as much leverage as it used to: private money is capable of dictating market courses sometimes now.

This week, the USD once again seemed to vacillate, appearing to be weak, only to push against that needs, then when bullish news came... It sold off!!

US markets had a bullish finish right at the end, with Incredible strength going into Friday. This meant downward pressure on USD.

USD? The USD is supposed to be strong right? All of the tail end analysis seemed to predict that the US dollar was going to bolt, but the smart money acted differently. Always remember that the news that you are being fed is indicative of what analysts are saying, not what the smart money is doing.  USD did **NOT** live up to expectations this week. It completely underperformed contrary to the Fed's releas on Wednesday. As well, US markets resurged coming into Friday, almost giving the impression that the bullshit correction that we had in January is over...

JPY? Ha! The Yen once again showed that it answers to No One, pushing back against all pairs including the Mighty Dollar.

CAD took a hit on Thursday with bad Canadian core CPI numbers, but then rebounded on Friday with a very strong finish.

AUD? The analysis has been that Australian dollar has been weak weak weak, so what does the Aussie do? It gains strength against the dollar....

EUR? Eur faded throughout the majority of the week with a strong finish against the weak Friday dollar. European Union seems to lack strength this week.... do not interpret this as a week Euro. This is more likely smart money repositioning itself. Remember that the European economy is on fire right now, which means it downward pressure on the EUR.

GBP? £ demonstrated some remarkable strength this week.

This triggered a big fat sell off that perfectly coincides with a modeled Panic Day, as well as EoM positioning and selling that is normal. the US stock markets *tanked* at close, meaning outflow to capital. 

DOLLA STRONK 

Be aware mañana likely more of the same.  0830 is big doin's for USD: Consumer Personal Consumption, GDP, Chicago, and Homes data, ~~then at 1000 Powell speaks *again.*~~ ( incorrect, this is an artifact. It appears that Powell was originally scheduled for today, but was moved to yesterday Tuesday February 27th due to a scheduling issue. So it appears he is not talking today.)  Zounds!

2857,2018-02-28,Dollar index tomorrow,"So we all know that inflation is higher than normal based on the recent CPI release (0.5% > 0.3%) and that the fed announced to increase the interest rate hikes to 4 instead of 3 this year. The next rate hike is in March. I think for the most part it has already been priced in and that's why we're seeing the double bottom formation on greenback.

Tomorrow is GDP release and I expect it to be lower than consensus. Right now it is testing previous highs and a close above 90.5 could be signs of a bullish breakout. Since GDP is going to be lower than expected though I'm thinking we got once more big drop before this climbs back up.

I'm interested in hearing any thoughts that support or disprove me.

If a commodity currency is doing well, does this mean the actual commodity is bad? What commodities is actually within ""commodities""? ( Oil? Coal? Etc? )

If the European currencies are doing well, what is the usual reason for it? Their stock market world?

2876,2018-03-09,AUD/USD Short Opportunity - Thoughts?,"Are interest rate differentials finally starting to dictate the AUD$/USD$ pair? While United States macroeconomic prospects have improved over the past couple of months, the USD$ has weakened against major G10 pairs. The USD$ weakness is surprising given that the macroeconomic improvements should warrant an appreciation in the USD$. Nonetheless, an opportunity to short the AUD/USD certainly looks attractive.

Common arguments for USD$ weakness across G10 pairs are political uncertainty, a focus on twin deficits, and attractiveness in emerging markets due to synchronous global economic growth. Although the AUD$/USD$ short has fared well since the end of January, the USD$ has yet to reach levels against the AUD$ as it had in early December.

The case for further depreciation of the AUD$ is built on the fact that interest rate differentials for AUD$/USD$ are negative and are expected to widen further. Australia’s economic growth and velocity of money are decelerating, which does not support a hawkish policy by the Reserve Bank of Australia. These key points, coupled with the improvement in the United States’ economy, should lead to an attractive trade in the short-term.",8,0.79

2883,2018-03-18,I think I will sell USD/CAD this week....,"why ?

It's on the monthly resistance point via Ichimoku.  The monthly chart is giving a ""weak"" (may or may not become a regular sell signal) sell signal via Ichimoku.

The weekly chart has broken out of the Cloud but the remaining structure is still bearish (a weak buy).  Also if you zoom out on the chart you can see that the downtrend hasn't been broken quite as of yet.

The daily chart looks like a clear buy on Ichimoku as well as the chart pattern that looks like a breakout.

The four hour chart looks like there might be the beginnings of a bearish fractal being printed.

The one hour has a confirmed bear fractal.

the 30 minute on down shows consolidation which means price could break out up or down.  The 1 minute is showing what I call reactionary selling just under 1.3100

The highest recent fractal on the 1 minute is 1.3098.  This means you'd put a buy stop here.  You'd put your stop loss around here too as it's a bear fractal. 

My stop loss will be 1.3100

This will be the type of trade i'll trade alot on and keep an eye on it until I can trail my stop somewhat safely.    I'm not going to put an actual stop 1.3100 as I know price can jump up , then back down.

But if a candle closes at or above 1.3100, then i'll manually exit the trade.

Lastly, I see 1.3100 has been a support area back around 1994-1996.  As of late price has been swinging back and forth around it.

My entry will be to observe how the weekly candle starts out (00:00 gmt)
and go watch the 1 minute,15 minute, and 1 hour to see what the price action is doing and for any potential fractal setups.  If I observe that the weekly high upon opening is respected, i'll go from there.
Prior to 00:00 GMT, it will still be finishing up the prior week/daily candle so to speak.  So i'll be seeing what's happening there as well.  

Or, if I was just going to risk my normal amount on the trade I would just set my stop at 1.3120 and not watch anything.  But it will be sunday evening so I'll be able to eyeball it for a while.

Edit:  it's also on the yearly/monthly high 


I fail to understand why some consider a loss (though small) as doing damage to ones account.  Does this mean there are traders here that have a 100% win rate and never lose ?  ",7,0.82

2891,2018-03-19,I expect 4 rate hikes,"Jerome Powell will make his first big mark. If Trump keeps his antics up I'm all for sticking to 3 rate hikes, BUT if we have a decent presidency that actually listened to the advisors I would love to see 4 rates and mid-2019 interest rates at 2% which would set it equal to inflation.

Although the Phillips curve has been discredited it is still useful for short-term inflation expectations. We know unemployment continues to fall so inflation should be expected to rise. We saw this happen in our last core PCE survey. *PCE = consumer price index which excludes energy and food

Taylor Rule (John Taylor was my preferred fed chairman after Janet Yellen) suggests that the Fed raise interest rates during above-average growth and stay neutral during steady growth.

Will we see an increase to 4 rate hikes? We can interpret after our next core PCE and employment survey. March survey will be released on April 11th. Another indicator for job growth is the S&P 500. I think despite the recent correction a higher S&P could bring us our 2.0% inflation rate.

Wednesday will end the 2 day meeting and we will have clear indication on which direction the Fed chooses to go, but my speculation is on 4 rate hikes this year. I am long the Dollar Index this week.

2892,2018-03-19,Would any experienced traders (or inexperienced) share some insight please.,"Good day to all you experienced and inexperienced traders alike.. Pardon me for this extremely long post, and i thank you in advance for spending the time to read this.

Basically.. I'm really passionate about Forex, not because of getting rich. But because i just love what Forex is and the ability to be well informed and stuff. For example.. it interests me how banks work, how monetary policy affects currencies and stuff.. I love the idea of being able to predict what is going to happen to a country/currency in the coming months and i love the thought of being informed about such stuff..

I come from a country where everyday is a 9-5 office job for majority of the country, in fact, Forex seems to be non-existent here (maybe its just me), its hard to find a mentor (because i know that it is important that one must learn live trading from a mentor to see his/her perspectives), but because only a minority (if it exists) does Forex.. its extremely hard to find a mentor.. Not only that.. There are 'courses' here that charge 4000USD for a single course which im pretty sure is just basic TA and FA that can be found on Youtube.

The only thing i can teach myself is stuff that can be found online.. Mostly TA, i have spent time and time over again to practice, buying at supports, selling at resistance. Candlesticks pattern etc and never going against a trend.. I started demo trading last October and i just started live trading on January this year. In my first week, i started with a live account of 200USD and with TA alone, i made 310 USD in a week. I felt unstoppable, i felt confident and that i know Forex in and out. I figured that i could trade my lifetime relying on TA alone. The 2nd and 3rd week were all profits without a single loss, earning and earning, i grew my account from 200 to 850 in a matter of 3 weeks. Then, it went downhill.

There was a week i cant remember, where i traded USD pairs and on that week, it was a really hectic week for USD as there were alot of news revolving it. (correct me if im wrong, which i think i am, it was the week where there was Trump's testimony or something like that, and then there was Theresa May's meeting with Trump and strengthening the pound) I took quite a hit of -120 dollars in total and because i didnt keep a journal then, i started to panic. Over the next few weeks, i tried to develop new TA analysis, usage of Bollinger Bands, MACD etc.. When i had profit, i was happy and thought 'this is the analysis that i will stick to', but when i had losing trades, i went on to tweak my methods.

I think it was the ending of Feburary where i was lying on my bed and thinking, why dont i just trade like how i did on the first few weeks, since it ended in many correct trades. So i began using my method of trading in week 1-3. During that week, i had a little bit more profit than i had over the last couple of losing weeks. (my account was at 400 balance at this point in time)

However, i was confused and sceptical to trade as i was really unsure.. Everytime i look at the charts, it was already either oversold or overbought on the RSI, and on the charts, a huge trend just took place and it was nearing either support or resis. I would trade against the trend when it was nearing resis/support and i got screwed really badly.

Today, i just blew my account trading EURJPY and EURUSD sell. I entered EURJPY at 129.626 and EURUSD at 1.22624. I kept holding even when my trades were going against me because i stubbornly refused to close, believing that my analysis was right. I kept holding as i thought 'its already overbought, surely it'll retrace soon' but it didnt. Its even worst because during the first few weeks where i was confident in my trades, i wanted to do my part to be a filial son, ( i come from an average family) and i told my mom and dad that i wanted to make money for them. They invested in me 1k USD which i am close to blowing it all, its sitting at 450USD now.. all due to my ignorance.

I was disappointed, frustrated that i blew my account. It is of course naive and stupid to think thoughts like ' i should have closed earlier when my losses could have been minimized' but what if it went to profit instead?? I was stupid and ignorant and i regret it. It was today that i realize that i have to pair fundamentals with technicals, but im just berating myself because i dont know where to start learning fundamentals, or actually, Forex as a whole.. I've been using indicators, such as RSI, automated trendlines and atuomated support/resistance.. I know that plain naked chart with self drawn S/R lines are best.. but i just dont know how to do it..

I do know that i shouldn't harp on the fact that i blew my account because everyone goes through it at least once, but i cant help it, the feeling sucks.

So that brings me to the question.. Would any experienced traders out there share where they learnt Fundamentals with TA?? It will be even better if a link or a book/course could be provided alongside it. I have always wanted to learn Fundamentals but because it is so broad, i don't know where to start. The only thing i know is that high impact news on the economic calender usually affects a currency long term, like FOMC/ interest rates etc.. I just dont know where and how to start learning it... Would appreciate if i could get a little help.. Be it in recommendations of books or links/courses.

Sorry guys for this extremely lengthy post, would really appreciate it if i can get any insight at all..

Thank you guys so much..

2904,2018-03-21,T/A on EUR/USD Post - Short Term Play in Range Bound Pair,"Hello,

I figured I would throw up some of my TA on this pair to get some critique from you all. Please feel free to volunteer what you will. However, being that I was in cash today, I was looking for an opportunity to get into this pair for shorter-term (hours to few days) participation. That said, I understand many of you wouldn't touch the pair until 1.25, or only started shorting at 1.25 so you wouldn't make any plays now, I am simply not in that position.

I have attached screenshots of my TA, which is simply based on Price Action and major/short-term levels; i.e. retested supports/resistances and supports-turned-resistance, as well as lower highs, lower lows.

I understand fundamentally there is strength in the EUR, however, it would seem in the past two months the pair is predominantly undecided and most recently is fading lower. On shorter TF, there seems to be range bound opportunity with the bias of a down trend in the past week and a half, and so I decided to track how the news would hit the market, see if it would break the short term down-trend and/or respect the current range.

Summary of Graphs:
Major Support/Resistance Zones on the 4hr/Daily - Gray Rectangles
Multiple-tested point of support-turned-resistance at 1.2340-1.2345
Smaller Lines show lower highs and lower lows (for me mostly). I give them significance until they are broken.

Graphs step down from H4 to M30.

My Signal:
Major move up from news today around 2p-3p EST. At the 1.2345 area, I am looking for a possible entry/convincing break. H1 was showing bearish sentiment, with a low close. Furthermore, in the meantime, the M30 formed a text book doji followed by an significant outside, bearish candle. Target is the 50% retracement of last swing low as that shows confluence with another tested price point and is a pretty major round number (yes, I took FX Academy's free course lol.)

Using that second candle for confirmation, I entered short (.03 lot size) at 1.2340. SL is 1.2352 (possibly too tight? At least range has tightened quite a bit); TP is 1.2300. Rough Risk of 12 pips to 40 or 1::4.

Thanks for reading, and again, I welcome all insight. I understand there are many different views. I, myself, am really trying to focus on PA based trading, in a set of time frames that will allow me to make shorter-term plays.

EDIT: My Fib was based on last swing low (from Tues into Wed, not from today's move).",8,0.91

Hope you made cash!

2911,2018-03-23,My parents asked me to invest their money in Forex,"MY BACKSTORY:

Hey everyone, my name is David, a 4 month-old forex investor. So far, I've been trading on a demo account in my free time, and I'm pretty successful. I have a trading strategy that fits me, as well as a job as a Currency Broker. 

I'm not trying to brag about any of that. I just want you to understand my background in Forex. 

Anyways, I just finished talking to my parents who have been thinking about this for a pretty long time. They know that I'm pretty successful in my job as a broker, but my parents have lost trust in me in the past, and it's only recently that I regained their trust. My parents are 9-5 workers who work hard and don't really have a lot of extra capital lying around.

They Initially asked me to invest about 200 USD, which I know isn't a lot considering I trade much more for my clients, but when it's coming from your parents, who kind of see you as a last hope, it's a bit scary, and to be perfectly honest, I know I can invest this money properly, but the fear of losing it all, and losing their trust is a scary thought.

TL;DR: My parents asked me to invest their money, I'm scared I might lose it and lose their trust. 

MY QUESTION:

**Has anyone you cared about ever asked you to invest their money? if so, how did you feel?**",4,0.7

I'm using a mix of technical and fundamental analysis, but I favor fundamental more. I only trade majors and I recently cut oil out of my strategy. I keep a blog of everything that I implement into my strategy, but I'm trying to keep this strategy agnostic.

I want to stay above 50% win-ratio and I think reaching 60% is a win. Recently the dollar started moving sideways and it messed with my strategy. I'm hoping that the dollar will commit to direction and we will see it slide until June-ish a couple weeks before the next interest rate announcement. Regardless my strategy still maintained PROFIT even though it started to suck. Never reached 0% or lower even though I was only winning 45% of my trades so I consider that a win.",3,1.0

On Monday the EUR/USD Pair first slipped higher and then fell back towards it's support later in the day, just as expected. Today the pair then went on to break the support and fall further down, possibly entering a bearish movement. On Wendesday we might expect a volatile price, as we will get the newest Eurozone unimployment data.

(https://www.dropbox.com/s/wx9v5nm9hbgtza9/Forecast0204-GBP-USD.pdf?dl=0)

On Monday GBP/USD followed up on the expected turn around and moved higher to 1.4077 but then slipped back lower to 1.4049. Today not much has been happening, the pair slipped a little lower but nothing to dramatic, but we might see a pulback to a support around 1.3997. To me the market seems rather unclear, but nothing unexpected happened until now.

In case that the pair remains temporarily bullish, pay attention to the nearby resistance levels at 106.34 and 106.79.

I am very new to the Forex scene. I run a business in Canada and we deal with a significant amount of USD.

1) How difficult is it be to deposit USD / CAD into an forex, convert it and withdraw the other?

2) How long do deposits and withdraws typically take? They would be in the area of a few hundred thousand dollars each.

3) Are any exchanges FDIC insured? Am I at risk if they prove insolvent?

4) What is the most widely used online forex that a Canadian can access? Some searching showed Oanada as a good choice, but we are open to other suggestions.

I am not looking to make money and explore trading strategies, rather just pay lower fees for this conversion when it necessary. We do not plan to use any leverage. We have looked into Norbert's Gambit, but are more interested in the forex approach.

3033,2018-04-27,CAD/JPY: Review & Forecast,"The rates have consolidated due to a lack of stimulus for growth. The deals to BUY seem the most effective with expectations of the trend resumption.

In April we saw a tendency to increase the demand for risky assets amid a decrease in geopolitical tensions. This led to a weakening of the yen, which peviously strengthened due to geopolitical tensions and a possible trade war. The extremely soft monetary policy of the Bank of Japan, which is not going to change the rate until it approaches the target inflation rate, has a negative impact on the yen. The Canadian dollar has received a significant stimulus amid this \- high oil prices and the achievement of long\-term price peaks, as well as stimulus due to the optimal situation in the Canadian economy, which has allowed the Central Bank and its head, Stephen Poloz, to maintain an aggressive monetary policy, unlike his colleague from Japan. According to Stephen Poloz, Canada's economy is recovering from the crisis caused by low oil prices, as evidenced by the achievement of 40\-year lows in unemployment, so the rate will be increasing in Canada if the situation does not change.

Two weeks ago the rates consolidated in the range of 84.32 \- 85.7 JPY. Both currencies for a while couldn't find new incentives to growth. Economic statistics in Japan do not impress investors and do not demonstrate economic growth that would allow the Bank of Japan to change its position on monetary policy. In Canada the situation is better and there are not enough risks for the Canadian economy that would put pressure on the CAD, but the decision of the Bank of Canada last week to leave the rate at the current level could not have a positive impact on the Canadian dollar, although investors expected such a decision and expect the Bank of Canada to raise the rate in July. As a result, volatility has decreased significantly.

3042,2018-05-02,Scalp Strategy: ISO criticisms/feedback,"1) Scalping: Profit ~3-5 pips

I feel like I stumbled on something here. Switched to range bars on Forex - best decision ever. With a 24hr market, the bridges and downtime’s are hard to sift through. Yes, with time chart, you can see “not to trade” but range bars continue to capture the market shape even through flat lines. That said, I chose 5 pip for two reason. First, randomness, and second, I am searching for short term strays, so 5 pip interested me. That said, I feel like there is a golden ratio between trading range and range bar choice. For some reason, 5 seems to work with the natural ebb and flow of EUR/USD. it SEEMS as if this our rarely only moves 10pips with the trend. In other words, in a noticeable short term trend (using 150 EMA as filter) if you get two consistent range bars, especially with tiny or no wick, a third bar (or more) will typically follow. Even if a retracement does occur, it’s even rarer that it goes above swing high (10 pips). 

So rules:

Enter on open of third candle. TP of 5 pips, SL opposite previous bar (not swing high/low for this particular strat, but option if you want to stay in trade). A possible modification (50k lot - half full lot): losing 5 pips with 1k = making 1 pip with 50k so, TP at 3-5 pips with 80%size. Even if price moves back, you net profit. HOWEVER, as it SEEMS the third bar ensues, you have the option to continue to manage a partial position while staying in the overall move and capturing profit of initial momentum. 

TL;DR : open on third bar as this pair seems to naturally move more than 10 pips with the trend. 

This may work most effectively during active hours of market, but I don’t trade full time so it’s been difficult to test long term.

Would love feedback based on theory or if you’ve seen success failure with similar strats!",2,0.67

3050,2018-05-05,What Foreign Paper to Buy and Hold Short or Long that's Actually Worth it and not a Scam?,"Hello Team Forex,

TLDR; What foreign currency, with what event, like war, or troops pull out, or a country's central bank to take over their currency and then revalue and go way up, much like what happened to the Kuwaiti Dinar?

I'm aware of the scams on buying various foreign paper, and I'm also aware of the issue of paying USD for foreign paper, and when you need to cash out, you lose to rate of exchange and inflation of the USD. That your better off at trading online, and doing it within minutes, hours or days at the most. 

I know that the idea behind buying the IQD, Dong, Won, Rupiahs, Yuan, and Iranian Rials is that the currency is considered undervalued if not artificially manipulated to be low. And that one day it will be revalued, so if you bought at equivalent of fractions of 0.0001 USD cent, and its revalued at $2.50USD equal at the exchange, then poof you're an instant multi\-millionaire.

It's all a matter of the likelyhood, the potential reality, and just when will which one of these undervalued foreign currencies will actually revalue, and enough so as to get past inflation, rate of exchange, and wind up well past break even.

So the question is, looking for one of the foreign currencies I mentioned, what event, like war, or troops pull out, or a countries central bank to take over their currency from a foreign occupier, etc will allow that currency to ability to then revalue and go way up, much like what happened to the Kuwaiti Dinar?

3056,2018-05-07,Thoughts on GBP/USD Around Late September?,"Hello /r/Forex,

My question is in the title. I will have to make a somewhat large payment in early October in GBP, although my money is currently in USD. I’m hoping someone who is knowledgeable in this realm can help me gain a better idea of where the exchange rate is likely to be come end of September. My options are to wait until the last minute to wire and convert, or to exchange ahead of time if the rate is solid. Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

Cheers,

3061,2018-05-11,AUD/CAD: Fundamental Review & Forecast," Sanctions resumption against Iran impacted the oil value and supports the CAD, as do the strong macroeconomic statistics. The deals to SELL seem the most effective.

The rates continue within a downtrend. The Canadian dollar is strengthening due to the rapid growth of oil value and good macroeconomic statistics. The Australian dollar has nothing to oppose this situation. Oil becomes more expensive due to geopolitical factors because the USA withdrew from the agreement on the nuclear program of Iran. They also plan to resume sanctions against Iran in full. This could lead to a disruption in oil supplies from Iran and some deficit of oil on the market. It is possible that oil will rise in price to $100 by the moment the sanctions are implemented again. The US actions are not supported in the EU and supposedly that this can lead to geopolitical tensions in the region.

The latest data about the Canadian economy shows continued economic growth. Investors were especially pleased with the PMI Ivey index of business activity which in April rose to 71.5 pips against 59 a month earlier. This is the highest level since 2011. The number of building permits increased by 3.1&#37; in March, also exceeding investors' expectations.

Today the Canadian dollar may receive new support with recent data on the labor market. On Monday will held a meeting of the RBA, which once again will make a decision about the rate. Given the current situation in the Australian economy and the RBA's commitment to a soft monetary policy, the rate is likely to remain at the same level. This, of course, will have a negative impact on the AUD in the short term.

 In this situation the most effective would be the deals on the trend. Oil, influenced by geopolitical factors, will continue to grow with the resumption of sanctions against Iran, or consolidate at the current high level of 70\-72 dollars. In any case, at the moment, the situation is fully in favor of the Canadian dollar. The Stochastic oscillator confirms the efficiency of short deals, taking into account the recently passed price correction and the current rates in the overbought zone. ",8,0.91

3064,2018-05-13,"FOLLOW UP Apology and Explanation to r/Forex for my ""Controversial thread""","Good Morning All, trust we are all feeling fine and dandy this morning. 

Following on from my ""Controversial Algo Thread"" ... This attracted a lot of attention, some of it unwanted, that said some of you were more open minded and I applaud that. Whilst this attracted a lot of negative attention the mods decided to Ban me from [r/Forex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex). I appealed my ban and it was rescinded with the caveat that the mods did not want to regret this. So alas this is an apology foremost and an explanation of a few things second. I was banned under the guise of ""Self\-Promotion"" ... People could not work out my motivation for sharing this, I figure that if people are getting this upset about it \(As seen on the other thread\) then I must be doing something right. I love reddit, I spend a lot of my time here contributing on various levels and subjects and using it as intended, I have also gleaned A LOT of information from it.... My plants are doing very well!! But I digress...

***My motivation was simple, Helping others. I am in a very fortunate position where I can do this and I will continue to do so.*** I am not worried about the same things some of you are in the sense that the algo will become useless, seriously if it got that popular then I am sure that someone would contact me and give me either a cease and desist letter or a job offer in the relevant field. What I do not is not up for discussion but it is far removed from this as a job. Some of you thought I worked for a broker, Specifically IG Index in this case. I can assure you this is NOT the case. I am using IG Index purely for the reason that they have been my broker of choice for years and they will continue to be as I deem prudent and necessary. That said I will be writing an Oanda version of my program in my own spare time. Pesky ESMA regulations are will hinder my program but will not stop it working. 

The algo itself was designed to stand the test of time and I am really hoping it will. 

Some of you asked for a general overview of the algo and how it works, I WILL NOT be releasing this. It exists. However, there are several personal reasons I will not be sharing this. If you want to learn what it does ask a programmer to help you. I have already seen this algo ripped off twice and claimed as their own. Also, if I did that it would be trivial for people to rip this off and gain commercially from this, I want to do that so I am not doing that. This is intended for PERSONAL USE ONLY. 

**PLEASE PLEASE if you are new to Forex DO NOT RUN THIS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU ARE DOING, I cannot stress enough run this in DEMO account only. It does not cost you any money despite people claiming on here to the contrary. There is no referral links, I am not harvesting data. I am nothing If not responsible that said it is design is that it can be set and forgotten about and it will work fully autonomously.** 

* A number of you have changed this to work with CFD’s instead of spread betting, this works. Please find and contact those users for it. I will NOT be providing any support for this app anymore, mostly down to the sheer negativity I got from some individuals that shall remain nameless. 

**That said, I WILL NOT be releasing anymore code. So sorry to those who are keen and interested in this, But you have the general ethos of the internet and the hive mind that is reddit to thank for that. Not trying to be harsh or a dick or anything that is just personal choice. I have started a Private Beta for those who have expressed interest and those who have I PM'd. I will be making various improvements but not limited to the following.** 

* **Use thilslopes instead of linregress.** 

*The Theil–Sen estimator is more robust than the least\-squares estimator because it is much less sensitive to outliers. This estimator can be computed efficiently, and is insensitive to outliers. It can be significantly more accurate than non\-robust simple linear regression for skewed and heteroskedastic data, and competes well against non\-robust least squares even for normally distributed data in terms of statistical power.\[8\] It has been called ""the most popular nonparametric technique for estimating a linear trend""*

* **Used sum / len for ATR function rather than max**
* **Added a Disclaimer**
* **Change spread from 1 to 1.5 to catch some minor pairs through the trading day, Pairs such as the GBP/AUD for example, But not limited to.** 

Whilst I can personally guarantee that this algo has made me an insane amount of profit, whether this is to be sustained or not is the case. However, at the moment I am riding the markets on free money. I have had various wonderful things out of this and at the end of the day are we all not here for one reason... Profit!!

3066,2018-05-13,EUR/USD consolidates recovery from 4-month lows,"EUR/USD up on Friday, flat for the week..
US Dollar stabilized during the American session against majors, up versus EM
The EUR/USD pair is rising on Friday for the second day in-a-row but it was unable to extend gains during the American session as the US Dollar recovered strength on the back of rising US yields.

The euro peaked on Friday at 1.1969, the highest since Monday. The area around 1.1970 capped the upside. EUR/USD is about to end the week, steady moving in a range between 1.1930 and 1.1960, marginally below the level it closed last week.

EUR/USD recovered ground after falling on Wednesday to 1.1821, the lowest since December. The weekly close far from the lows could signal some consolidation ahead. Some bearish pressure is still seen. The weekly chart is about to form a doji, after rebounding at the 20-week moving average.

Next week, key data from the Eurozone is due, including GDP, ZEW survey and CPI. In the US, retail sales on Tuesday area likely to gain attraction.

As such, if I choose my max drawdown to be 1%, it would mean I'm making 14.5% in a year.

Since I don't mind having two or even three trades open at the same time, I end up opening the same position three times in slighly different, but highly correlated, charts.

I've thoughts of a way to combat this, and I'd love some input.

1. Trade 12 pairs instead of 4.

2. Divide them into three groups of 3 pairs.

3. Each group would be exposed to the same currency. For example, AUDUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD and EURUSD would be the USD group, and is currently all I'm trading now.

4. These group would depend on the three largest currencies: EUR, USD and JPY.

5. I will only have up to three trades open at the same time, and only one trade per group.

I will keep my risk per currency at 3% - anything more and I won't take the trade.

For example: I go short on AUDUSD and USDCAD, risking 1% each. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/NWnCBU0).

I am exposed to USD by 2%. As long as my exposure per currency does not exceed 3%, I can open trades. If opening new trades would bring me beyond 3%, I can either choose to reduce my position size or not enter the trade at all.

So here is where I get confused. AUDUSD is testing the weekly support line which may turn it into a resistance line. However... If the US Dollar is going to enter monetary tightening then this means that the Aussie needs to strengthen more in order for AUDUSD to still go down.

USDJPY is also retesting the weekly support line BUT I know that if greenback goes down then so should USDJPY. This makes sense. If USDJPY and AUDUSD should be inverse right?

Here is the reason I believe that Greenback will enter monetary tightening. Unemployment is below full employment. We have 3 to 4 rate hikes with June pretty much being guaranteed. The S&P 500 is continuing to go up (which means that firms have extra cushion). Treasury bond yields are rising. Inflation is 2&#37; or above which was the fed was aiming for.

I'm pretty sure the June interest rate is already priced, but the other 3 might not be. I am worried about the foreign tariff's. If steel tariff's go into place then that could be bad news for Aussie. If Aussie doesn't strengthen then the trend line might still be a support, but who knows. Also if tariff's do come into play then we can see USDJPY can Gold climb higher. They tend to climb higher during global political turmoil.

Oil prices are rising which means that there might be an artificial increase in US inflation (I remember hearing the fed mentioned not to pay attention to monthly CPI data because it could be wrong). I try to keep track of the difference between the change in disposable income and the change in oil prices monthly and quarterly. As long as the oil futures prices are decreasing lower than disposable income than I think consumers can still retain purchasing power. As unemployment goes up though I can imagine this will become harder and harder as monetary tightening progresses. I am curious if Canadians retain their purchasing power because one of Canada's biggest exporter is oil. Hopefully marijuana will become Canada's next biggest export!

I was taught that gold is a safe haven for the dollar which helps keeps the dollar in check, but does this also work for the S&P 500? Most high dollar investors look to get residual income. The Benjamin Graham strategy is to find blue chip stocks that pay the highest dividends and then when the S&P 500 becomes volatile store the money in bond yields. Why would an investor that is looking for residual income store their money in gold?

Regardless the gold weekly chart is looking like it's creeping closer to breaking the monthly/weekly resistance line. If the dollar starts to climb much higher the price structure might break though.

3136,2018-06-08,"""the dollar will move higher as capital again flees Europe"""," Comment from ZeroHedge (better than the article it's commenting):

>""And  anyone who thinks that the US currency is going to explode higher when  the ECB is about to ends its QE program needs their head examined."" This  is exactly the reason why the dollar will move higher as capital again  flees Europe. This has been happening since 2011 moving not only the  dollar higher but also the Dow. Again Armstrong Economics computer  models forecast all of this back in 2009 predicting dollar strength and  the US equity markets moving higher from international capital flows.  Again in June of 2016 the models forecast that if gold did not break the  1362 reversal level at July's close this would indicate capital is  again moving out of Europe and this would cause massive dollar strength  and the Dow would continue to move higher. Gold closed at 1361 dropping  to around the 1100 handle and the dollar gained strength and the Dow  moved much higher. In fact there was so much capital being converted  from euros to dollars that this actually created a dollar shortage in  foreign markets prompting the FED to ask all central banks with excess  dollars to flood the international system. Even China did so as the  dollar was making US imports to China extremely expensive and hurting  their exports. Of course the alt media was full of claims that China was  dumping dollars and treasuries as they no longer had any faith in the  assets. To show you how wrong the alt media was, China then started to  buy treasuries in late Jan. 2017 for over a year buying billions a month  to replace what had been sold. Of course the alt media has been  claiming for over 5 years that the dollar and Dow would collapse ""any  day""  Bullshit!  
>  
>    The models have forecast that as we move to the end of 2018 the  capital flight will again accelerate out of the EU and move into dollars  and the Dow as Europe comes to a head by 2021. It is flat broke.  Spain's pension fund runs completely out in 2018, (along with many  others including the MEPs pensions in Brussels), all of France's cities  are insolvent, (migrant cost), and has ask for help, over 50&#37; of all  German cities are insolvent, (again migrants), and even the German  Health Ministry announced yesterday that they completely  ""underestimated"" the cost of migrant health care and now has over a $3  billion deficit. This is a time when German industry is complaining to  Berlin that they must lower taxes so they can compete or they are  threatening to move production to the US. Germany has already the  highest taxes of all any western countries. These are not isolated cases  but is happening in most of the EU. Just look at Italy and Spain. This  is the tip of the iceberg. Of course we have Sweden sending out notices  to all citizens to prepare for at least a week with no government help  and the National Guard announcing a nationwide ""drill"" and are you ready  for this. The reason? The Russians! You can't make this crap up. Why  the hell would Russia want to occupy Sweden? The people in Europe has  totally lost it.  
>  
>   The ECB knows it must taper or more capital flees as the euro goes  south even faster at the end of the year. This means the only sector to  buy toxic sovereign debt is the private sector and they will demand  much higher rates due the the risks and to pay for the much higher  insurance associated with the risks. My question is what firm would  underwrite and sell risk insurance on any sovereign debt in the EU. Even  Germany is in trouble and in addition both Italy and Spain own the  Bundesbank over 1 trillion euros each thru the Target 2 Settlement  Mechanism as capital also fled to Germany. The reason is that when the  euro goes the capital will be converted to marks, hopefully. The  remaining capital is taking no risk and has and still is moving to  dollars.  
>  
>    The computer models track domestic and international capital  flows and large amounts of capital moving out of a market or country or  trading block always causes severe economic downturns, bank failures,  businesses failures, sovereign debt defaults and the collapse of  existing governments. Ring a bell? By 2021 the shit will have already  hit the fan! Where else is left but dollar assets which has become an  enormous problem for them as they have been desperate to weaken the  dollar not only so they can have some flexibility in bring back yield,  (think pensions here) and also when the capital again accelerates from  Europe to dollars. Are you really going to park it in any EU bank? EU  countries sovereign debt? Those dollars and that Dow don't look that buy  now, do they? It is not about a return ON capital but a return OF  capital. Leaving it in the EU means you get nothing!

3151,2018-06-14,The FEDS Hawkish Dovish statement,"Or was it dovishly hawkish? If you are asking yourself wtf does that even mean then you need to brush up on *fundamentals*. Anyway I wanted to post this because I had a good discussion with a knowledgeable trader on this forum about fundamentals and made the statement that it isn't about knowing something others don't or knowing before they do, it is about knowing how the known facts will affect price. This is very difficult and ambiguous and some would even say foolish. I think fundamentals are important but can understand why other traders feel differently.  

So what happened and what am I even talking about? Well, the FED raised rates as we all know **and even signaled they will be hiking again this year, according to the dots that is**. (Again, if you don't understand what dots im talking about google fed dot plot and read) That was unambiguously hawkish and the dollar shot up on the news. Now things get tricky, price reversed its initial move (as is not uncommon during high vol news) This is being attributed to headlines about tariffs.  

So both things that happened today, the FED raising and sending a hawkish signal and the news about tariffs, the market already knows. You could argue that signaling a fourth hike was somewhat a surprise but the majority opinion on 3 vs 4 was only one vote and it was well understood that the one vote could go for 4 this year instead of 3. So there are two points I want to make as advice/help/opinion about fundamental analysis. 

The first point is that if you mostly disregard fundamentals and let technicals dictate your trading nothing that happened today was unusual. Yes there was more volatility but if you look at USD price action after a strong rally the last two months it has tested and held support in AUD,EUR,NZD and started a small decline. After such strong rallies you can easily see consolidation/retracement before strong continuation, and today could just be a really noisy day in the process. 

The second thing I want to say is for those of you looking to sharpen or get another opinion on fundamental analysis. So if you were going into today with the thought of a USD rate rise being bullish for the USD, you are behind the market because the market has known this for months. The logic of a rate rise today being bullish USD has been realized by the market long ago, and as I discussed above, so was the additional rate increase. Seeing the price action today you can see that this was largely what the market gave us. Now for the fundamental analysis of what happened today (the new information the fed gave us). This is more difficult but I will attempt to portray my understanding of it here. If you look at the overall state of the financial markets, you see bond yields at respectable levels in the US, extremely over valued US stocks, and an economy about to experience the first meaningful rise in interest rates in 10 years. While I am not a stock trader or economist and in no way can predict what will happen when in those areas, **it is clear the cycle is mature and will probably be ending with these FED increases** Today on Bloomberg someone said bull markets dont die of old age, the fed takes them out behind the shed and shoots them in the back of the head. So to put this as short as I can because I am dragging on here now, **the market thinks the FED is closer to the end of the tightening cycle than the FED itself.** The bond markets think they are close to fully pricing in the tightening cycle by the FED. The FED removal of the sentence about rates staying below longer run averages for sometime can be read into as them acknowledging the reality of the situation we are in as rates have risen closer to longer run averages, it could also be read as the FED believes the longer run average of the fed funds rate is lower. This is extremely nuanced fundamental analysis **but the removal of that sentence can be seen as dovish. Thus the hawkish dovish statement.**  

I can't tell you what trades to make from this fundamental analysis, I think of it as more of a guide to interpreting the rest of my strategy, but as for price action, a liquidity event/market sell off would probably be bullish USD so it is hard for me to give up being a dollar bull until we get that, and with rates near  priced in that would probably mark a top in the dollar. Like I said fundamental are hard to interpret and nothing I said is a holy grail or makes making trades that much clearer, but we could see a very volatile/profitable market the next 6-18 months. Be careful and use your risk management. Hoped this helped,  

Good luck  ",11,0.79

I'm based in Europe and therefore my base currency is EUR. However I want to trade USD quoted Futures without currency risk, so I'm looking for options to Hedge EUR/USD

For that I'd need a Broker that allows negative balances & equitys without eliminating running positions.

I thought about putting (example values):

 - 1.000€ in the FX Broker account ( 10% of Futures Account Value as margin requirement with high leverage, so that the Futures Account remains as big as possible )

 - $10,000 in the Futures Account

And go long EUR/USD for so many units, that the pip value equals the same.
Now if EUR would rise against USD I would be fine - but if EUR would fall below the USD Entry level there would be a negative running position in the FX account, that I would cover manually once I withdraw funds from the Risen Futures USD account ( risen in Value against EUR and hopefully in profits as well )

Do you know any Broker that allows such behaviour or a more ellegant way to solve this Problem?

I saw a job ad for this forex educational company in Greece called AKFinancials that is hiring trainee traders. I contacted the trainer (Anastasios Katsoulakos) and he said they are opening an office in my city and seeking immediate hires.

To be hired you need to pay USD 1500 and attending their training course and pass the evaluation. To pass you need to earn 5% a month without exceeding 10% drawdown. I asked Anastasios Katsoulakos about the possibility that one month is too short of an evaluation period but he says it is impossible to fail if you follow his trading rules. If you are hired and trade with them for 1 year you can get a refund of the USD 1500. The caveat is that a 10% drawdown at any time will result in you being terminated. Seems like a red flag to me because 10% is not a large amount at all.

Does the above sound like a scam? I have heard of some companies using this course fee refund as a hook to get victims, and then do their best to make sure the trainees fail the evaluation. The company also seems to be registered in Seychelles which is immediately suspicious. If anyone has an opinion or knowledge of AKFinancials, please let me know.

3171,2018-06-21,Fundamental Analysis Question,"Hello guys, please spare me 5 mins to read my post. Just a newbie needing advice. Sorry if i took up your time.  


So basically i started trading Forex since April 2017. Where im from, its a very mundane country. Everyone focuses on their office 9-5 job and go back home for dinner and sleep, therefore only (im guessing) 5&#37; of the population here does Forex. Those who 'teach' Forex charge ludicrous price (4-5k USD) which i dont have the privilege of paying. When i first started, all i can learn was TA, since it isnt as broad as FA, and i've been doing well, every month's been profitable since April relying solely on TA.   


When i first started, i wasn't in it for the money. The thought of predicting how a market will move based on fundamentals interests me, i want to learn how to be able to do FA, such as understanding how bonds work in Forex, predicting Monetary Policies/NFP and all that just by reading and analyzing Fundamentals. It isn't more of a 'i want to do FA just for the $' but more of a ' i'm really interested and i want to learn how it works'. But the thing is, Fundamentals cover such a BROAD area and i'm really lost as to where i should start learning and how i can continue. I go through Forex Reddit everyday before going to bed, hoping to connect the dots on a few posts (like how bonds affect Forex markets, how people are able to predict the outcome of a news etc, safe havens and all) but all i end up is being jealous and amazed at how people can analyse Fundamentals till that extent, i really want to do that too.   


With that being said, can anyone point me in the right direction/provide learning materials of where i should start learning Fundamentals, i'm really stuck because Fundamentals in itself is so broad and i don't know where to start.

I'm based in Europe and therefore my base currency is EUR. However I want to trade USD quoted Futures without currency risk, so I'm looking for options to Hedge EUR/USD

For that I'd need a Broker that allows negative balances & equitys without eliminating running positionspositions ( even when the running position is more in the red than the Account balance )

I thought about putting (example values):

1.000€ in the FX Broker account ( 10&#37; of Futures Account Value as margin requirement with high leverage, so that the Futures Account remains as big as possible )

$10,000 in the Futures Account

And go long EUR/USD for so many units, that the pip value equals the same. Now if EUR would rise against USD I would be fine - but if EUR would fall below the USD Entry level there would be a negative running position in the FX account, that I would cover manually once I withdraw funds from the Risen Futures USD account ( risen in Value against EUR and hopefully in profits as well )

Do you know any Broker that allows such behaviour or a more ellegant way to solve this Problem?

Thank you :)",0,0.5

3182,2018-06-24,My EUR/USD Thesis,"Hey everyone, long time lurker here. I'm a Finance/MIS student with experience in equity/crypto markets, and now looking to be profitable in forex and to contribute to this community.

I have put together an argument for why the EUR/USD will be headed lower for the rest of the year and perhaps into 2019. There are both technical and fundamental aspects that will be presented, with an imgur album attached with a 4H, 1D, and 1W chart. The daily chart is attached with the post. Let's get started!

Technicals:

1. From a 40,000 ft. perspective, the weekly chart presents a price channel going back to 2008 that the pair has traded in. In early 2018, the uptrend of 2017 halted and then reversed from the upper bound of the channel, while at the same time breaking downwards out of a symmetrical triangle formation - a clear reversal formation.
2. On the daily chart, we have the 50 day SMA crossing the 200 day SMA on June 6, the first time this has happened since the beginning of an uptrend in May 2017.
3. There is a potential descending triangle forming, which is labeled on the daily chart. There have been two overhead rejections, and two bounces from the supply zone. On the first bounce labeled ""1"", there was a bullish engulfing candle that failed to generate a significant rally - then on ""2"", there was not nearly as much buying pressure present off the bounce, signaling a likely continuation of the downtrend once the triangle is broken.

Fundamentals:

1. The Fed is further along than the ECB when it comes to raising rates. The U.S. economy continues to experience strong growth in almost all sectors which has led the Fed to steadily increase interest rates. On June 14th, the ECB announced rates would remain unchanged which led to a bearish reaction for the EUR/USD.
2. While the U.S. has been no stranger to political instability, the EU is increasingly being affected by eurosceptic forces. The Italian populist government recently gained power and is implementing anti-EU policies and has considered dropping the Euro/leaving the Eurozone. Angela Merkel could potentially be ousted as Chancellor and thus the de factor leader of the EU over migrant policies.

The trade, and where it could go wrong:

I will open multiple trades after a retest of the supply-turned-demand zone at 1.151, with take profit levels outlined by the gray zones and the black line representing the height of the descending triangle. Trade wars, a downturn in the US equity market, and the de-dollarization in the world financial system are the three big threats to this thesis. If you have advice, opposing views, or just want to tell me I'm wrong, please let me know. Thanks!

3215,2018-07-10,I created a technical indicator based on neural networks,"Hello, I'm a PhD student specialized in machine learning and I've been fascinated about the Forex markets since 2009. I've recently finished a technical indicator that I've been designing for the past... many years. I was wondering if you guys were interested at checking it out. I'm posting a sample of the indicator for the AUD/CHF market ([https://imgur.com/2sKVSu6](https://imgur.com/2sKVSu6)), using a 4-hour timeframe. Please tell me if you are interested on a particular market/timeframe and I'll post a pic of it.

Basically, if the price (white line) is in a orange-red area, it means it could stagnate. If it's in a blue area, it is moving fast. But the interesting part is that you can see that the price will soon reach an orange-red area (so you should stop trading, or not start a trade) and if it's moving towards a blue area, it will most likely become wild.

I've traded for 1 week until now using it and I've made 0.6% of profit (I like to trade very small lot sizes in Oanda). I'll keep trading and hopefully I can move to use this indicator alone (plus common sense) in the future. I use it for Forex markets, but if you're interested in other markets tell me (it should work for other markets too). Just make sure it's listed in Oanda's assets (I use their API to get the data).

EDIT: You can try it for yourself using this link: [http://predictus.ngrok.io/index.html](http://predictus.ngrok.io/index.html) it's hosted on my machine, the front-end is badly programmed and there's literally no error catching. In other words, it will most likely explode sooner or later. Also, I'm using ngrok and I think it limits the number of connections, so I wish you luck.

3216,2018-07-10,Brokers for long term positions,"


Hey everyone!

I’ve read a bit of online resources now, but it seems that most of them are geared towards intraday trading. I’d like to trade currency in the long term, and hold on to those positionings (low number of transactions per year - sitting on some currency pairings). Basically, what I’m looking for is similar to exchanging cash to another currency at a favorable rate and changing it back in a few months (rather than a few minutes) when the rate favors my base currency less, of course with minimal fees and strings attached. How does leverage work in the long run and would I incur any additional fees? 

I’m not sure if this kind of trading is even available for small amounts like 10000 USD (are currency always purchased in lots of 100k?), but would any of you know how to achieve this? Also, I don’t feel like I need any leverage for the type of long term trading I’m thinking of, especially if it will come with greater fees. For example, do brokers typically charge interest or other fees that make it less desirable in the long term? Would trading 1/10th of your desired units at 10:1 be the same as no leverage? I hope that some of you have some experience with this and might know where I should look.

Thanks in advance!

Cheers

Next I put in more money this time to make sure I’ve enough to survived the price spike. Then come the day when USD is so strong that it move like 2,000 pips overnight, then I’m broke again. Lesson learn to put Stop Loss / Take Profit before sleep. This lesson cost me ~3,000$
Now I stop trading by myself and start to use other people EA. Loss another 500$. Learn that past profit does not guarantee future even the best EA on earth has it down time.

3225,2018-07-13,"I have a theory that seems counter intuitive. Lets talk, it might seem confusing.","Forex is a little different to stocks as you know, the liquidity providers ( banks ) are willing to honor trades 24/7 to anybody, hedge funds, market makers, brokers, large, small traders. Banks will take the opposite end of your trade instantly. For retail traders it's more than likely your broker. Your small lots are never really pushed to the market, the broker / market maker might use his retail traders as ""ammunition"" to accumulate trades for release at moments where critical mass can make a difference, brokers can also put in a huge trades using his own capital plus the retail traders orders as further weight to move the market using critical mass or conversely spread the orders out over a few hours to mask / get rid of trades and hide the direction. The brokers / market makers / hedge funds get their liquidity from the banks.  Retail traders get their liquidity from their brokers, or if you walk into an actual bank and get the shitty daily rate.

The theory and concept - which seems counter intuitive.

When people think there is more buyers than sellers, they assume the price goes up since there's more buying pressure and the opposite for when people think there is more sellers, they assume the price goes down. This is all backwards, hear me out for a second even though it seems crazy. 

Lets use a currency pair as an example, EUR/USD.

If everyone ( brokers, hedge, market makers ) started buying EUR right now the liquidity providers ( many banks providing the actual money ) are processing all these buy orders, everyone wants to buy so the banks needs to honor these trades and sells to each and every trader, the liquidity provider is selling to the market makers to the hedge funds, brokers and then the broker / market maker deals with you in a few different ways depending on the broker. So at first you would assume the price would go up since everyone is buying the asset there is less of it available and the price gets more expensive, same goes for the inverse, but this is incorrect in the eyes of the banks.

Where we go wrong in understanding what is actually going on is in the charts, they fool us, those charts you watch in your broker platform / trading view is a representation of the liquidity providers perspective, not yours, not the brokers, not the hedge funds, not the market makers, that chart on trading view is the liquidity providers (all banks on aggregate) trades.  When the prices moves up it's because THEY are buying ( forced buying from our selling) , not us.

When you see the price on the chart go up, it is the banks that are buying because the traders are selling, we are more or less forcing them to buy our sell trades, it is their trade that paints the candle, not ours.They give us access to the 24/7 liquidity, it is them providing the money, it is their side of the trade that is shown. So if we all buy right now ( retail, market makers, brokers, hedge funds ) and every single one of us pressed the buy button this very moment at exactly the same time, the price would absolutely 100% undeniably spike downwards very very violently. We all pressed buy at the same time, the liquidity providers computers would see all this crazy buying, they would be forced into honoring every single trade and sell to us, the candles that get painted on the chart shows their perspective. They just sold, we just bought, the price would go down. NOT UP. We all bought, yet the price moves down violently because they did the selling, they own the liquidity, we don't. 
 
So for example, when you see the price trending upwards, you look at the chart and you say to yourself the price is going UP, you think it's because the traders are moving the market in that direction, this is wrong. What is actually happening is the opposite. When the price continues to move upwards this is telling you that the traders are actually SELLING, the price moves up because its the liquidity providers that continue to buy up all those sell orders. 

So the next time you see a pattern in your system and you see price reaching a certain level, say the top of a channel and you have your trend lines drawn in, remember that all retail traders share ideas, they all draw similar trends lines and all follow some form of TA, if you believe there will be a lot of ""Traders"" buying or selling at a certain point, think about how the liquidity provider needs to react if all those trades coming in, its always the opposite. Next time you see an upwards trend, just know that its the traders actually selling to create that upwards trend, it continues to trend upwards the more traders keep selling while the liquidity provider keeps buying, so the price moves up, the price will only change direction when the traders start to buy and force the liquidity providers to sell, which makes the market go downwards.

I hope my idea is clear.

Momentum, carry trade and the search for unfairly priced currencies have not generated impressive returns this year, and this has led some investment managers to abandon them in favor of event strategies and niche rates. OppenheimerFunds Inc. she reduced the time spent in a number of positions to weeks from months, and the investment company Standish chooses dollar options, believing that they will benefit from the risks associated with trading friction.

Conditions for currency trading were difficult in 2018, amid uncertainty over the prospects for global economic growth, tensions in trade relations and political unrest. The dynamics of the dollar led investors into confusion: the us currency grew for three months in spite of the pessimistic consensus formed after the collapse last year by 8.5%.

""This is more of a market for traders than a market for certain styles of investing in currencies,"" says Alessio de Longis, portfolio Manager in the global group of mixed assets OppenheimerFunds. — This is not a year when you can invest, guided by a given strategy, and wait for an attractive return on long-term investments in the framework of the carry-trade, search for undervalued currencies or momentum strategies, if not add a tactical component.""

So, the currency has appreciated against the dollar? Why is the CAD appreciating with higher than expected YOY inflation?

3250,2018-07-22,Currency war between the USA and China will haunt the world,"Currency war has begun.

So consider some insightful participants of the foreign exchange market, with daily trading volumes of $ 5.1 trillion.
 
On Friday, US President Donald Trump accused China and the European Union of ""manipulation of exchange rates and interest rates."" This comment was made after the yuan fell to the minimum level for the year, and the Bank of China did not make any attempts to restrain the national currency. In addition, the Euro also lost ground this year, claiming to be a factor that the ECB may have to take into account at the upcoming monetary policy meeting.
 
The world's leading powers entered into confrontation, balancing dangerously on the brink of war, and the consequences of this will be disastrous, not only for the US and China. The danger threatens asset markets from Beijing to Washington: stocks, oil, emerging markets will be victims of the redistribution of the world financial order.

*""We note the serious risks of a large — scale collapse of trade and currency cooperation at the international level, and this is depressing,"" warns Jens Nordvig, one of the most authoritative currency strategists on wall street. He adds that trump's latest rhetoric "" has clearly shifted the emphasis from the trade war to the currency war.""*

Shock therapy, associated with the devaluation of the yuan by China in 2015, is a vivid example of what the Domino effect may be, says Robin Brooks, chief economist of the Institute of international Finance and former chief currency strategist of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. It is likely that in this case the prices of high-risk assets and oil will fall due to increased concern about the economic prospects. The currencies of commodity-exporting countries, including the Russian ruble, the Colombian peso and the Malaysian ringgit, will be particularly affected, and then the rest of Asia will fall.

*""Asian Central Banks will first try to restrain the weakening of currencies through interventions, but then give up, and in the 6-month perspective, the greatest losses will suffer, I think, the assets of developing countries in Asia,""* writes Brooks.

According to Nordvig, the decisive factor will be the position of the Central Bank of China — in particular, whether it will try to restrain the exchange rate of the dollar against the yuan at 6.80 to avoid further escalation of the conflict. The expert notes that at the ECB meeting on July 26, the head of the Bank Mario Draghi may also enter into a struggle, if we remember that the January attempts of the us verbal intervention against the dollar in Frankfurt met with extreme disapproval.
 
According to Reuters, on Friday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the US is closely watching China to determine whether it is manipulating the exchange rate.

*""Undoubtedly, the devaluation of the currency gives them an unfair advantage,""* he stressed, adding that the States will closely monitor this situation.

The next semi-annual report of the Ministry of Finance on monetary policy, in which the US authorities officially comment on the position of countries that manipulate currencies, will be published in October. In the last April report, the Agency refrained from such accusations against China, although it criticized China for the lack of progress in eliminating the trade imbalance with the United States.

*""The exchange rate is one of the many instruments that China can use to counter US trade tariffs. At the same time, they will try their best to prove that their actions are not due to the actions of the United States, and we can not say anything for sure. As a rule, we do not know the true scale of intervention,""* says economist Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel prize winner in Economics and former Advisor to President Clinton.

The dollar is likely to remain under pressure, as investors are wary of Trump and listen to his statements, and therefore will come out of long positions on the us currency, said Shahab Jalinas, chief currency strategist of Credit Suisse Group.

According to the Commission on futures trading for the week of July 17, hedge funds and other speculators are now showing the most optimistic since February 2017 attitude towards the dollar.

*""However, now the US President actually declared a currency war, openly accusing a number of States of manipulating their exchange rates to ensure a competitive advantage. This will force market participants to start the elimination of long positions on the dollar,""* Jalinus believes.",24,0.92

3286,2018-08-10,Up-size my trading,"Hello

I have been trading part-time for 7 years and on full-time for the past 3 years. I would like to hear your opinions on how to take my trading to the next level.

1. My account is about USD 18,000 equivalent. 
2. So far I tried to do 1:2 or at least 1:1.5 risk-to-reward ratio.
3. I have been restricting my risk to 0.3 - 0.7% of my account equity.
4. I normally trade a contract size of 10,000 (0.1 lots) or lower, depending on my r/R and risk %.
5. My win-rate these 3 years trading full-time is approximately 65%. (note: win includes closing slightly above breakeven).
6. I trade more on technical analysis on W1, D1, H4 and occasionally H1 timeframe.
7. As I am trading full-time without a regular salary, I tend to be very cautious and conservative in my risk% and lot size. I have blown an account once when I was still earning a salary - that was a great lesson for me.
8. My last 3 years performance so far = 10 to 15% p.a.
9. Now, I would like to up-size my trading to earn more meaning profit amount. Eg. Raise risk to 1% of account equity and trade approximately 0.2 or 0.3 up to 0.5 lots size. 
10. But I am a bit afraid to trade slightly larger size. Maybe it is due to me not having a regular pay check as a ""back-up"". Maybe it is because I do not have enough confidence. 
11. But I am waiting till the end of this year to see my full-year performance. If it maintains my previous 2 3/4 years performance, I am thinking of trading a larger size. 

May I hear your views on my situation? Really appreciate that as I would want to take my full-time trading further and persevere.

I firmly believe that NAFTA will either fail or become a bilateral deal between the U.S. and Mexico excluding Canada. The Canadian government has underestimated Trump's determination to achieve substantive compromises from its trading partners, and is under pressure from its domestic politics to not make any compromises, as it will be seen as weakness and ammunition for the opposition party to use in the upcoming election.

Trudeau has every reason to let NAFTA fail, as it will galvanize his support across the country and set him apart on the world stage as someone who is finally standing up against Trump. As a result, I believe that Canada will not offer any substantive compromises to the U.S. in the next round of talks, that will satisfy the Trump administration, leading to a bilateral deal between Mexico and the US, and a withdraw from NAFTA.

However, as a nation that is 75% dependent on the U.S. for its export market, I believe that a withdraw from NAFTA will have significant impacts on the Canadian economy. Now is the time to sell/short CAD and buy USD.",6,0.8

Let's talk.

[Turkish Lira shit the bed Friday](https://www.tradingview.com/x/78uRwLFL/).  I wouldn't normally worry about an emerging economy's currency as I don't trade exotics, and they tend not to cause too much trouble when they go haywire.  The ramifications here are a bit different, and because of irresponsible lending by the ECB and others, along with increasing bad debt on Turkey's behalf, these ramifications have wider effects than just TRY.

The problem comes that [European banks are worried](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-10/citi-s-exit-from-turkey-looks-smarter-every-day-lionel-laurent) about their exposure to Turkey's bad debt.  [Turkey is calling for ridiculous levels of rate raising](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-there-may-be-more-pain-in-store-for-turkeys-lira-on-friday-2018-08-02) to counter inflation and to try to supercharge their now weakening currency.  At first, this will bolster the TRY, but the trade off will likely be much more painful: rampant inflation will likely destabilize the currency.  This comes hand in hand with a stronger dollar, which hurts many emerging nations as borrowing is much more expensive and painful, slowing their growth, which then perpetuates the cycle as investors slow their capital due to lower growth targets.  On top of this, [Trump is moving forward with tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum,](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/turkish-lira-loss-deepens-as-pm-erdogan-calls-for-citizens-to-convert-.html) a major export for them.  Ouch! 

EDIT the end point for this is a potential new European debt crisis that potentially spirals into a global correction or worse. Stay tuned, history is being made as you watch....

Esoterically, Erdogan is using the ***SAME TYPE*** of language that other dictators use during tough times. Rewind to Venezuela during their crash; both Maduro, and before him, Chavez used this same goofy rhetoric of coming together, not sparing for yourself, and offhandedly suggesting that those who are hiding money out of fear are part of the problem, are exacerbating ""the enemy's"" position, and are potential traitors for not believing in the central government.  This is a red flag for me, as throughout history, this type of strong man language is a harbinger of worse times to come.  As u/gorillaz0e has [pointed out](https://old.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/969x4j/the_moment_erdogan_spoke_about_economy_turkish/), the Lira took a dive as Erdogan started to speak as the speculators, banks, and economists saw this same thing: all talk, no substance.

There's a decent chance that ECB will float *another* loan to try to shore this domino up.  We will see how it plays out this weekend, and Monday. Make sure you [read this article and thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/966bcl/jim_rickards_predicted_an_imminent_debt_crisis_in/) by u/J32926

3293,2018-08-12,Underestanding the factors at play in the value of the Lira,"Hello there r/Forex. Just joined this sub as my interest in Forex grows and has been growing for many years now but has never been enough to get me to invest. But given the current events it would be a shame if I didn't look to get some experience out of this. As a final year medical student my knowledge of economics is as extensive as a course on supply and demand curves back in school so let's keep this simple. I guess at this point the questions is weather you pour your money into USD/TRY or the other way around and at this point it seems like it's not very clear which side will be the winner and which the loser. I decided to enumerate the factors that are at play here for and against the Lira:

For

1. Increase in interest rates in Turkey - which if my knowledge of basic economics doesn't fail me, means that foreign investment will pour into Turkish banks in the form of Turkish Lira and thus help keep the value of the currency.

2. Other world powers such as Russia may come in and lend a helping hand to Turkey and keep them afloat.

3. A decrease in the value of the Lira means a country more attractive to tourists and thus a thriving economy with the Lira in circulation.

Against

1. Similarities between Erdogan's rhetoric and others like Chavez who we have seen sink their country into dirt.

2. Doesn't seem like Erdogan will be backing down any time soon and we sure know that backing down isn't in Trump's list of things to do.

3. Erdogan's plea to the Turkish people to sell their USD to keep the Lira afloat - He has a lot to support in Turkey so this might just play a role. 

As I said before this list is by no means complete and I have zero experience in Forex and underestanding how world events influence the value of currencies, so please add and correct anything or everything written and make as much fun of me as you like. I want to improve my learning curve and so I came to you guys directly. It is an honour to me among you.",4,1.0

   2. European Central Bank drops vow to remove stimulus; adds liquidity instead.
   3. UK adds to Quantitative Easing to offset economic drag of fiscal austerity.
   4. Chinese property bubble bursts.
   5. US yields rise as US economic recovery gains strength.
   6. US adopts comprehensive long-term fiscal program modeled after Simpson-Bowles Commission recommendations
   7. USD retains and builds on reserve currency status as central banks shun euro and reduce existing holdings.
   8. Geopolitical uncertainty in Iran, Korean Peninsula revive USD safe-haven status.
   9. Bank of Japan, Bank of England, and European Central Bank embark on expansive new monetary easing, including Quantitative Easing.
  10. Bank of Japan joins Asian neighbors in actively managing the JPY FX rate
  11. Commodities bubble bursts as fear of dollar collapse abates.

Potential US Dollar Minuses

   1. US and Japan join global sovereign debt crisis; gold and other metals benefit
   2. US yields fall as US economic recovery flags; deflation fears revive
   3. UK economy rebounds despite austerity; Bank of England raises rates to contain inflation
   4. US yields soar as government fails to get a handle on fiscal policy and market loses confidence
   5. Risk appetites rise, fueled by a rush of global central bank liquidity sending metals, agricultural products and energy sharply higher
   6. Emerging markets continue to grow steadily, drawing capital from developed markets
   7. JPY resumes climb versus USD and Asian currencies as Japan keep money at home rather than seek higher returns abroad
   8. European sovereign debt crisis abates; banks replenish capital
   9. China engineers a soft landing, restraining inflation without damaging asset markets
  10. India overtakes China, becomes the market focus in emerging markets

62,2011-02-16,A common misconception about consumption and savings (with cakes and bacon!),"**A common misconception about consumption and savings (with cakes and bacon!)**

Let’s do a really quick and simple thought experiment.  Suppose there are 3 people in this world: me, Bob the Baker, and Sally the Saleswoman.  Bob is baking a super awesome cake that will take a whole week to finish!  He doesn’t really like cake, but he wants to sell it to me or Sally and buy our stuff.  Sally is your ordinary saleswoman of consumption goods.  For simplicity’s sake, let’s say this world only contains $1, we can’t split this dollar bill, and I have it right now.

What are my choices?  I can consume $1 right now, but then I won’t have the $1 to buy the super awesome cake (for now, let’s ignore the possibility I can sell something to Sally for that $1, or borrow it).  Or, I can save the $1 and buy the cake in a week.  For me, there’s a strict trade-off between consumption today and consumption tomorrow.

So that’s the micro view.  What happens on the macro level?  Suppose I save $1 now.  In a week, I’ll have $1, ready to buy the cake.  Nothing changed so far.  Suppose instead I spend the $1 buying stuff from Sally.  In a week, I can’t buy the cake, but Sally will have $1.  There will still be $1 in the economy to buy the super awesome cake, the difference is Sally gets it instead of me.  We can clearly see that consumption today does NOT trade off with consumption tomorrow on the macro scale.

So what can reduce future consumption?  One way is to waste resources on things that aren’t valuable.  This is important, but not really the topic of this post.

The second way would be if there’s too few savings, resulting in a high interest rate discouraging future investments.  Suppose if I saved the $1 and let Bob borrow it.  Then Bob would use that $1 to hire me to build him a bacon replicator over the course of the week.  I’d still have $1 to buy the super awesome cake in a week, and now we also have a bacon replicator!  Awesome.  What if I spent it instead?  Normally, Sally can then save it and loan Bob the money.  It’s only if neither of us make the loan that we’d miss out on the bacon (maybe because of timing issues between when I take the money out of the money market and when Sally puts it back in, or because Sally charges a higher interest rate in general).  You can see in this example how current consumption doesn’t have to trade off with current investment on the macro scale in a closed economy.  Someone will have the $1 at the end of the day, and they can make the loan so Bob can invest in that bacon replicator.

A third way to reduce future consumption would be if the money is saved, and it gets stuck.  This happens both in the micro view and the macro view.  Micro view: suppose I have $1.  I stick it under a mattress and resolve to hold on to it.  No one can borrow it, so no one else has money.  There’s no consumption in the present period, and there’s no consumption in a week when the cake is done (no investment in the bacon replicator either).  The economy has produced one cake, but no one gets to eat it (Bob doesn’t want it), and sadfaces are seen.  Macro view: suppose the $1 gets stuck under a mattress, whether by me or by Sally after I spend it.  Same thing, in one week the cake is done but there’s no one to buy it.  Sadface again.

**Tthe moral of the story is, on the micro level, my current consumption trades off with my future consumption.  On the macro level, current consumption does not necessarily trade off with future consumption (or current investment for that matter).  However, saving without the borrowing of those savings will reduce future consumption.**

----------------

P.S. Here’s a simple change to the model to include the effects of cash flow.  Suppose the economy is me, Bob the Baker, and Henry the Helper.  In order to bake that 1-week cake, Bob needs Henry to help him out with the cake.  To finance Henry’s salary, Bob sells cupcakes to me every day.  I pay Bob, Bob pays Henry, and Henry buys my stuff.  Suppose this breaks down somewhere, either because I hoard the money or Henry does.  Oops, tomorrow no one buys Bob’s cupcakes.  Bob can’t pay Henry.  Now the baking process is disrupted, and the cake is either totally ruined (liquidating the assets) or no longer super awesome (business disruptions arising from bankruptcy).",0,0.5

85,2011-03-03,What if the US Federal Government was a business? How should we be thinking about it?,"So recently there have been some articles looking at the USFG as if it were a business.  I felt like a lot of them are missing some important points.  Here's three insights we can draw if we think of the USFG as a business.

1) The USGF should invest to increase economic activity.  In a broad sense, we can think of the USFG as an owner of a vast residential, commercial, and industrial complex.  Most of its revenue comes from a royalty on all economic transactions in its domain.  Thus, it's perfectly justified to invest or spend money to increase economic activity, whether that's to improve infrastructure, provide services such as health care, educate its workforce, or even to provide extra liquidity when businesses or citizens need it.  These are all things that businesses do today, of course to much more limited extents.

2) The purpose of a business is to maximize shareholder value.  And the shareholders of the USFG are the citizens of the country.  So even beyond point #1, the USGF is probably justified in spending money to improve the welfare of its citizenry, even if it means taking on extra expenses to do so.  Think of this as a dividend, except in services instead of cash.  This is perfectly justified if the services cost less for the government to purchase and provide, than for people to pay for them individually.

3) To the USFG, cash is non-voting common stock and dollar-denominated debt is stock options.  Like a company's common stock, the USFG can print as many USD as it needs to.  It'd be stupid to say a company is running out of common stock, and it's exactly the same applied to the government.  Obviously, if the company issues too much common stock, then it gets diluted and the value of it drops significantly.  However, it's entirely possible for the value of a company to actually increase after a stock issuance, if such an issuance would let them take on positive NPV projects.  This is also the case if there is a temporary situation like a short squeeze (or a liquidity squeeze) which drives the company's stock price above its fundamental value.  Such a squeeze also makes people reluctant to sell their shares (aka spend money to buy stuff), which reduces economic activity and thus the USFG's revenue.  In that case, it should issue new shares and use them to fund investments, like the aforementioned infrastructure improvements.

It's probably important to note that debt in a foreign currency is a liability and not equity.

4) Edit to add: A company can't control its net income, and the USFG can't control its surplus or deficit.  What they can do is control their spending and their pricing and production schedules.  However, simply cutting costs might reduce net income or increase the deficit if they result in the loss of positive NPV projects.  Sometimes the best way to grow the bottom line is to increase the operations or the R&D budget.

**All this aside, at the end of the day, the USGF is not a business.**  So most of the stuff analyzing the USGF as if it were a business kind of misses the point.  But maybe these insights can help inform the debate on USGF fiscal policy.",4,0.58

96,2011-03-10,Math abuse?,"Hello,

I worked in the investment industry for about seven years, I hated it and left to study physics.  I still keep up on the financial news.  Mostly out of habit though.  I was reading [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/china-trade-deficit-2011-3) article and had some offhand thoughts about the numbers presented.  I'm probably interpreting it incorrectly.  I've got some extra time this morning so I figured I'd see what others have to say about it.

The part that caught my attention was...

""Outbound shipments rose an annual 2.4 percent, the slowest pace since November 2009, and imports climbed 19.4 percent, according to a report on the customs bureau website today.""

19.4%? 2.4%?

First of all, these percentages are annualized, and you are comparing them to November 2009?  Given the November number is probably also annualized, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me either.  It is making a rather gross generalization about what 12 months COULD look like if things didn't change.    I would guess if you averaged the actual numbers when available, your results would be considerably lower, making these two numbers practically meaningless made up nonsense.  I would also assume that by now we have actual 2009 annual numbers, so we are comparing what real happened, to an expectation.

Something else that bothered me is that aren't these listed in %/%?  It's a rate of change of rate of change.  Acceleration vs velocity if you were equating it to a car.  Its the equivalent of saying, well, for the last 12 seconds, I accelerated my car from 30-60.  So by the end of 12 minutes, I'll be traveling 150 mph.

It appears to me that beyond being just a made up number, it's presented in a fashion that ""feels"" larger then it is.

It reminds me of the recent sales tax hike in Maryland.  During the elections, I kept hearing ""so and so raised our local sales tax 20%"".  In reality, it went from 5 cents on the dollar, to 6.  Yea, I get it, +20% of what it was, but this is math abuse, sales tax rose 1%.

Anyway, I guess this is mostly a rant looking for other peoples opinions on the presentation of numbers than anything.  To me, it's math abuse.

One of the reasons I left banking was over numbed abuse, I couldn't stand it.

Note:  I'm not bashing this article in particular per se, my rant isn't about this article, it's the more general abuse of math that I see that is ever so common in the media, especially in relation to economics.  Also, am completely open to being told ""hey dumbass, you don't understand what these numbers you are looking at mean"".  Basically, ""you're retarded"" is an acceptable answer :)",7,0.72

* Customers, when the corporation is able to pass on the cost of taxes by raising prices.

* Workers, when the corporation pays its workers less or hires fewer workers in response to corporate taxes.

* Capital owners (i.e. shareholders) when taxes lower profits.

Which group bears the burden varies by industry and over time. And there's a lot of complexity within these categories too. After all, pension funds are major shareholders, and CEOs are ""workers"" too. 

So if you want to make sure the rich pay their ""fair share"" why not just tax rich people directly, through capital gains and income taxes? Thoughts?",7,0.67

153,2011-04-18,Critique of Fractional Reserve Banking,"Examining 10% fractional reserve banking from a mathematical perspective, up to 10 people hold claim to the same dollar.  Please feel free to point out any flaws in this model.

To demonstrate, let’s presume the following conditions....

* 10% fractional reserve banking, all money loaned, all money deposited
* For simplicity, the collective of all banks is called  “the bank”
* Starting point: 10 resources, 10 physical gold, valued at 1 gold per resource
* Gold and claims on gold are denoted in units of $.

Let’s begin....

* Physical gold deposited, resulting in $10 in deposit claims.
* **Total:** 10 resources, $10 physical gold (“original currency”), $1 resource price.
* Bank loans $9 gold, which is spent, then deposited.
* **Total:** 10 resources, $10 gold, $19 deposit claims, $9 debt
* Given infinite time, price will stabilize to $1.9/resource
* Loan $8.10 gold, which is then deposited.
* **Total:** 10 resources, $10 gold, $27.1 deposit claims, $17.1 debt, $2.71/resource
* .....continued to iteratively to maximum possibility.....
* **Total:** 10 resources, $10 gold, $100 deposit claims, $90 debt, $10/resource

This demonstrates that loans will always create a GDP boom and inflation, as dollars & resources change hands at increased frequency.  Meanwhile, wealth (resources) and original currency (gold) are unchanged (fixed variables), suggesting that booms are artificial appearances.

It is an elaborate shell game, where you hope everyone doesn't claim their deposits (a run on the bank).

Also notice the following ratios.

* $10 gold deposit claims : $1 real gold
* $9 gold debt : $1 real gold
* 1 resource : $1 real gold
* $10 price : 1 resource

To put this in another context... How is it logical that 10 full claims exist on every apple, or the 1-apple-to-orange exchange becomes 10-apples-to-orange under fractional reserve?  Is gold (dollars, currency, etc) any different?

Let us also take at the flip-side of loans, repayment.  Lets assume the following...

* Bank requires a simple 1-time 10% interest on every loan.
* Enough time is allocated for deposits to shuffle into repayment.
* The bank doesn’t spend it interest payments.

Let’s watch....

* $90 initial debt x 10% = $9 interest ...&... $90 initial debt + $9 interest = $99 new debt
* **Total:** 10 resources, $10 gold, $100 deposit claims, $99 debt
* $1 deposit repays $1 in debt
* **Total:** 10 resources, $10 gold, $99 deposit claims, $98 debt
* *(singing) $98 of debt on the wall, $98 dollars of debt, take one down, pass it around...* until eventually
* **Total:** 10 resources, $10 gold, $1 deposit claims, $0 debt

We now see the boom and bust cycle, without the creation of a single resource or unit of gold.  This challenges the notion that loans facilitate growth by demonstrating booms are artificial, and demonstrates loans and interest are destructive.

Thoughts?

*P.S. This also suggests fractional reserve banking and inflation are a ponzi schemes.  Early adopters (Those who loan, spend, or invest first) are at a major advantage in the inflation curve compared to those who save or are at the end of the inflation curve (i.e. working class).*

166,2011-04-24,Who should run a cash deficit?,"It seems like lots of people here want everyone to be cash flow positive.  We hear all the time that people should spend less than they earn.  Of course, businesses should be profitable, which usually means sustaining positive cash flow at some point.  Many say the government shouldn't run a deficit.  And finally, many want a trade surplus as well.

While economics in general isn't a zero-sum game, cash flow is a zero sum game (with the exception of printing new money, but people don't seem to like that either).  In order for you to have an additional dollar, the rest of the world in some form must lose a dollar.  For instance, if there's only $10 in the world, and you go from having $2 to $3, then the rest of the world now only has $7.

That means we can't possibly have a situation where people on average spend less than they earn, and businesses on average are profitable, and government runs a surplus, and we have a trade surplus (especially for a trade surplus, since that by definition has to net to zero across the world too).

So who should have negative cash flow?  Keep in mind it has to be of sufficient **quantity** as well to finance everyone else's positive cash flow.

If this completely doesn't matter, then please point this out in the comments.  It's possible I'm not thinking this through entirely, and I'd be interested to know why.",3,0.61

Effectively capping annual income at $1 million. There is no corporate income tax but there are targeted levies for pollution clean up and the extraction of non-renewable natural resources. There is also a value added tax (VAT) of 10%. In addition to the income cap personal wealth is also capped by taxation at $1 000 000 per year of life (eg you 18 years old your total max networth $18 million, 65 years old, $65 million.) At the end of life the estate is taxed back to $1 million. The million dollar cap for all these figures is anchored as a multiple of national average income (calculated by mean and mode) so if the national average income increases the caps increase accordingly.

205,2011-05-09,"Dear /r/Economics/, I've got a riddle for you: The Capital Gains Tax Paradox","As many of you know, ownership of stocks incurs a tax at the point of sale called the *capital gains tax*. What you may not know is that the capital losses also apply on losses up to $3,000 between the purchase and sale and reduce your taxes below what you would ordinarily pay.

**Here's the paradox.** Suppose for the sake of simplicity a fictitious government such that 

* capital gains tax is fixed at 5%, effectively charging you 5 cents on every dollar that you gain on each trade, and 
* capital losses refunds your losses at 5%, effectively paying you 5 cents on every dollar you lose on each trade, with *no upper limit on either*, meaning they *might end up paying you lots of money* if your investments turn very sour. (There was some confusion on this point on whether or not I really meant no upper limit.)

Isn't this equivalent to having a friend call you up before you make the trade, asking you to buy one share on their behalf for every 19 shares you buy on your own behalf and asking you to sell all of their shares whenever you sell yours and simply square away whatever the difference is? For example, if you buy 80 shares at $2 and sell all 80 shares at $3, you pay $4 in capital gains tax, the same amount that you would pay your friend if you had traded 4 stocks on his behalf and 76 on your own behalf. Conversely, if the stock drops to $1, they pay you $4 to cover the loss in value of their 4 stocks. 

Consequently, isn't the government in no better or worse shape than your friend who used you to facilitate the trade? Was the amount earned by your friend by trusting your judgement in stocks?
Has the fictitious government in this scenario crowdsourced the picking of stocks, copying our collective buy and sells and reaping some fraction of our ensuing proceeds that ensue? If you really wanted 80 stocks for your own and not 76, couldn't you have just started with 85 stocks to start with? Are there other factors at play worth considering? Is the government profiting off of your wise decisions in the stock market? Is the government ""copying your homework"", benefiting from your research into which stocks are valuable? Arguably so, but is there more at play? Is this activity somehow ""parasitic""? Does it adversely affect you? Is there something I'm glossing over?

In some ways, this oversimplified scenario is biased as more lenient than the current U.S. system because under the current system losses are capped to $3000 per year. (If not for this cap, would our capital gains tax be a non-tax?) However, it is biased in the other direction in that the U.S. long-term capital gains tax rate is often less than bracket that the rate that capital losses deducts (your income bracket).",0,0.33

I would like to see them discussed, because these are things I am curious about. **please reference the point/points you're contrasting or discussing**

#1 The Chinese economy has grown 7 times faster than the U.S. economy has over the past decade.

#2 According to the IMF, China will pass the United States and will become the largest economy in the world in 2016.

#3 According to one prominent economist, the Chinese economy already has roughly the same amount of purchasing power as the U.S. economy does.

#4 At the turn of this century the United States accounted for well over 20 percent of global GDP and China accounted for significantly less than 10 percent of global GDP.  But since that time America's share of global GDP has been steadily declining and China's share has been steadily rising.

#5 Nobel economist Robert W. Fogel of the University of Chicago is projecting that the Chinese economy will be three times larger than the U.S. economy by the year 2040 if current trends continue.

#6 According to Stanford University economics professor Ed Lazear, if the U.S. economy and the Chinese economy continue to grow at current rates, the average Chinese citizen will be wealthier than the average American citizen in just 30 years.

#7 During 2010, we spent $365 billion on goods and services from China while they only spent $92 billion on goods and services from us.

#8 Since 2005, Americans have gobbled up Chinese products and services totaling $1.1 trillion, but the Chinese have only spent $272 billion on American goods and services.

#9 The United States has lost an average of 50,000 manufacturing jobs per month since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and the U.S. trade deficit with China is now 27 times larger than it was back in 1990.

#10 Back in 1985, the U.S. trade deficit with China was 6 million dollars for the entire year.  For the month of April 2011 alone, the U.S. trade deficit with China was 18.8 billion dollars.

#11 Since China entered the WTO in 2001, the U.S. trade deficit with China has grown by an average of 18% per year.

#12 According to a recent report from the Economic Policy Institute, between 2001 and 2008 the U.S. lost approximately 2.4 million jobs due to the growing trade deficit with China.  Every single state in America experienced a net job loss due to our trade deficit with China during this time period.

#13 The United States had been the leading consumer of energy on the globe for about 100 years, but last summer China took over the number one spot.

#14 China produced 19.8 percent of all the goods consumed in the world last year.  The United States only produced 19.4 percent.

#15 China now consumes 53 percent of the world's cement.

#16 Last year, China produced 11 times as much steel as the United States did.

#17 Since China joined the WTO, approximately 46,000 factories have been transferred from the United States to Asia.

#18 China now has the world’s fastest train and the world’s largest high-speed rail network.

#19 Is alternative energy the future?  If so, the Chinese economy is positioned well. China is now the number one producer in the world of wind and solar power.

#20 Chinese solar panel production was about 50 times larger in 2010 than it was in 2005.

#21 Today, China controls over 90 percent of the total global supply of rare earth elements.

#22 85 percent of all artificial Christmas trees are made in China.

#23 Back in 1970, 25 percent of all jobs in the United States were manufacturing jobs. Today, only 9 percent of the jobs in the United States are manufacturing jobs.

#24 The United States has lost a staggering 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.

#25 Between December 2000 and December 2010, 38 percent of the manufacturing jobs in Ohio were lost, 42 percent of the manufacturing jobs in North Carolina were lost and 48 percent of the manufacturing jobs in Michigan were lost.

#26 There are more pigs in China than in the next 43 pork producing nations combined.

#27 China now possesses the fastest supercomputer on the entire globe.

#28 Back in 1998, the United States had 25 percent of the world’s high-tech export market and China had just 10 percent. Ten years later, the United States had less than 15 percent and China’s share had soared to 20 percent.

#29 Manufacturing employment in the U.S. computer industry was actually lower in 2010 than it was in 1975.

#30 In 2002, the United States had a trade deficit in ""advanced technology products"" of $16 billion with the rest of the world.  In 2010, that number skyrocketed to $82 billion.

#31 Over the past 15 years, China has moved up from 14th place to 2nd place in the world in published scientific research articles.

#32 According to one recent study, China could become the global leader in patent filings by next year.

#33 Do you remember when the United States was the dominant manufacturer of automobiles and trucks on the globe?  Well, in 2010 the U.S. ran a trade deficit in automobiles, trucks and parts of $110 billion.

#34 According to author Clyde Prestowitz, China's number one export to the U.S. is computer equipment.

#35 In 2010, the number one U.S. export to China was ""scrap and trash"".

#36 In 2009, the United States ranked dead last of the 40 nations examined by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation when it came to ""change"" in ""global innovation-based competitiveness"" over the previous ten years.

#37 Russia and China have announced that they have decided to quit using the U.S. dollar and instead start using their own national currencies when trading with each other.

#38 A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted a while back found that 61 percent of Americans consider China to be a threat to our jobs and economic security.

#39 The average household debt load in the United States is 136% of average household income.  In China, the average household debt load is 17% of average household income.

#40 China has accumulated the largest stockpile of foreign currency reserves on the entire globe - $3.04 trillion as of the end of March.  That figure was an astounding 24.4 percent higher than it was exactly one year earlier.

249,2011-06-14,This is what I feel about the world. Please tell me I'm wrong and it isn't this depressing. ,"Overall trends : Uncertainty and Inflation concerns. 
 
**USA**: Soft economic numbers, QE2 didn't really do as much for the economy as expected, but will end on June 30th. Having reached their debt ceiling few weeks ago, a QE3 might not be a good idea. With unemployment high and housing yet to recover, it's not easy to be very bullish on the USA. Disappointing job numbers and  inflation concerns (which may lead to Monetary Tightening later this year don't help. 
 
**JAPAN**: Debt to GDP ratio of 210%+ , electrical shortages and no solution to their aging population. Not to mention unknown costs of the tsunami / earthquake. The only thing remotely positive is the massive amounts of money that the government is injecting (printing) into the economy - possibly lowering YEN and improving exports. Though with damanged manufacturing ability, it's hard to see how they can take advantage  of that.
 
**EUROPE**: With the exception of Germany, pretty bearish on the Eurozone, due to their previous austerity measures (the govt spending less). The current Greece debt crisis (have you ever seen anything rated at Caa1 before??) hanging like an anchor around the Eurozone's neck, continued austerity measures, and high unemployment for young people, not too bullish here either.
 
**CHINA**: Trade figures show that demand for Chinese goods may be slowing, which is not surprising with the current lack of confidence worldwide. Domestic demand may also be hit by the cooling of the overheated property market. This is something to keep a close eye on, as there is a chance that the government's economic tightening measures may be too heavy handed, in a period where demand on exports weaken. 
 
**AUSTRALIA**: The strong mining and export market is a glimmer for hope in this dismal report, and the recent decision hold interest rates steady (not raising them to combat inflation) will probably lead to more growth in the region. However, the AUD is trading very high right now, and in a slowing global economy, exports of raw materials may be hurt. An overall positive outlook despite inflation concerns. 
 
**INDIA**: Interest rate increases have reduced their inflation concerns, as well has slowed the economy slightly (still at a robust ~8%). This may cause them to hold rates to hold steady for the remainder of the year as consumption growth has also slowed. However, this year's potential high goverment spendings in the domestic infrastructure bodes well for the future growth of this country (assuming that it's not heavily eaten into by corruption and actually leads to results). High oil and agriculture costs may slow things down though. ",11,0.74

256,2011-06-22,Taxing the rich,"Hi Reddit, 

I have been lurking around for a while now (r/politics, and reddit in general) and only decided to make an account to post today. From what I can tell, most of reddit is somewhere on the left of the political spectrum. Personally, I am an atheist, pro-choice, for gay marriage, for the legalization of marijuana and against US military intervention in foreign countries, so not exactly a right-winger, but there is one area in which I disagree with the majority of reddit, and that is taxes. Many have been clamoring for raising taxes, especially on the rich, to bring down the deficit and improve services such as health care for the less fortunate. While I sympathize with this view, I believe this will not have the intended consequences. I think a lot of people misunderstand the source of our wealth. As a mathematician and a fanatical amateur economist, I’d like to give my perspective on this topic. 

**Disclaimer: a long story is to follow. Also, as someone paying a lot of tax, I have a direct interest in this topic and am therefore not to be trusted. **

I think most of us can agree that we want to live in a society where everybody has access to basic needs such as food, water, housing, and healthcare, and everybody can make a decent living. Currently, not everybody in the US has access to these things, especially healthcare, and many people barely earn enough to support themselves from paycheck to paycheck. At the other end of the spectrum, there are people who earn far, far in excess of what anybody could reasonably need or want. One could be forgiven for proposing a simple solution: those who earn in excess of what they need contribute part of the excess to help those less fortunate. The high earners still have enough left to live in relative luxury, while many are lifted out of poverty.  To see whether this works, we have to move beyond money and consider the actual, real goods being produced. 

What is the difference between being poor and being rich? The poor can only obtain very few of the goods they desire, while the rich can obtain much more. A poor person might be limited to purchasing food and shelter, while a rich person could also purchase an expensive car, a vacation to an exotic destination, or a congressman. The way for a society and everyone in it to become richer, therefore, is to produce more of the things people want, in the long term.  Producing more things people want can mean simply making more of things already in existence, improving the quality of these things, or introducing an entirely new product that did not previously exist. If I conjure up an iPhone 4 with a magic wand, there are more things in existence. If I introduce the iPhone 5, the quality of goods has increased, and the iPad gave us a product that did not previously exist. In all of these examples, we are richer than before. 

The supply and quality of congressmen is unfortunately rather constrained, so what can we do to produce more of the other things we want in the long term? Well, the total production is equal to the number of people who are producing things (the labor force) times the production per person. While the labor force as a percentage of the total population does change, for example in recessions and depressions or due to societal shifts (women entering the workforce, young people studying longer, people retiring later), in the long run the size of the labor force more or less moves with the size of the population. Therefore, we can concentrate on the production per person. What decides the production per person? Production in this context is more broad than simply the total amount or mass of items produced: if someone produces thousands of tube radios with little effort, he or she is highly efficient but his or her production would still be zero since nobody wants a tube radio anymore. Production per person is therefore determined by the combination of what a worker produces and how efficiently he or she produces it. 

At this point capital enters the picture. Capital is created when people create more goods than they use. The goods that are left over, or saved, can then be used to create yet more goods. The common example is using those savings or capital to build a machine to increase production. In this example, more things we want are produced. However, capital is applied much more broadly. Someone who has saved up capital is looking to trade the goods he produces for goods he desires (get the most money for his produced goods) and is therefore careful to produce only what people are willing to trade for (buy). In this way, consumers of goods ultimately decide what is produced and in what quantities which ensures that the goods that are produced are the goods that are wanted most. 

The application of capital, or saved up goods, makes sure that only the things people want are produced, and makes the production of these things more efficient, thereby increasing the production per person.  People with saved up goods build machines so that each worker can produce more of the things we want, they invest in new methods and new technologies to improve and build more of existing products and invent entirely new ones, thereby increasing the production per worker. To increase the production per worker, which means we make more things that we want, therefore, we need to consume less than we produce and accumulate capital. This is really the key point: to get richer, we need to save and accumulate capital. In this way, everybody produces more and better things and can therefore consume more and better things. The more we save and the more capital we accumulate, the more new products and technologies get invented and the more efficiently we can produce the things that we want. 

At this point, some people will say: not everyone gets richer, just the people who have the capital. This is not the case. When each worker can produce more, there is higher competition for workers, so salaries go up and unemployment goes down. On the other hand, since we can produce goods more efficiently, they get cheaper, and so the salaries go further in buying the things we want. In effect, employees typically get to `take home’ a portion of the goods they produce and trade them to others for the things they want. When they produce more goods, they have more to trade with and are therefore richer. The United States is so wealthy because generation after generation consumed less than they produced and they were able to invest their savings freely, spurring incredible innovation and development, and causing the production per worker to be extremely high. 

The fact that the richest 1% of Americans possesses 35% of total wealth and 20% of total income invokes a lot of outrage everywhere, understandably. It’s important to note that the richest 1%’s share of total wealth is much higher than their share of total income. This is due to the fact that people with low incomes do not have much money left over to save while people with higher incomes tend to save a lot more. If a poor person and a rich person get an extra dollar of income, the poor person is likely to spend most of that dollar on food, clothing, and shelter while the rich person, already possessing these things, is more likely to save most of the dollar. And here we come to the problem with taxing the rich to pay for the poor; the rich person would have saved that dollar, ultimately increasing the production per worker and making everyone richer, while the poor person or the government is likely to consume it. This may be an entirely rational and understandable decision, but in the long run it is bad for everyone, including the poor. This is true even if the government does not tax the rich but instead borrows  - borrowing ties up capital that could have been used elsewhere. The worst of all are taxes on capital, such as capital gains tax or dividend tax, since these make it unprofitable to save and stimulate people to consume instead.  

It is true that income inequality in the US has grown over the last decades. However, if we examine the statistics more closely, this inequality originates entirely from only two counties in the entire US: in the rest, income inequality is virtually unchanged. These two counties are Santa Clara, also called Silicon Valley, and Manhattan. The income disparity from Silicon Valley is due to unprecedented technological investment and a good thing (the software millionaires and billionaires got that way by developing innovative new technologies and services, thereby hugely increasing production per worker and benefiting everyone). The inequality from Manhattan is more ambivalent, as a substantial part of it is caused by an unproductive expansion of the financial sector and increased Wall Street salaries, mainly due to implicit government subsidies and ineffective and distortional regulation, combined with undiscerning customers and investors and crooked and/or incompetent Wall Street CEOs. 

There are many reasons the economy is in trouble, but some of the most important and underappreciated ones are: the savings rate over the last decades was far less than it used to be, capital was siphoned off to less productive government spending (including wars) and unnecessary housing, and excessive or misguided regulations in nonfinancial sectors make it more difficult for capital to be applied optimally. Finally, the rich are taxed much more than is apparent, but that's for another topic.

**tl;dr the ONLY way to get richer is by saving and accumulating capital, taxing the rich has the exact opposite effect. In the long run, if we save more even the poor will be better off.**  ",5,0.61

Austerity measures mean that their citizens suffer. 

Would it be a good idea for them to ""wipe the slate clean"" and default?

**BEFORE YOU DOWNVOTE ME TO OBLIVION:**

Many European countries have individually had many defaults. Other countries around the world have also had defaults, and recovered. The most recent being Iceland, but also Russia and Argentina. 

Granted, those are more commodity based economies, but how bad can defaults on the EU/ USA front be? 

Maybe it's a paradigm shift - Sovereign Debt does NOT always deserve AAA ratings. Governments NEED to behave responsibly.

309,2011-08-02,The environment is not right for political use of Keynesian economics.  Why do we let politicians claim Keynes?,"Keynesian economics is supposed to be used when the government has a great amount of the money, but the citizens have no money to spend themselves.  By creating liquidity, you drive demand, and can jump start a dead economy.  

If I am correct: The average US citizen has some money on them now.  The average US citizen can pay for food, and has a place to crash.  So we don't need a jump start in demand of food/shelter.

I think politicians just want to spend money because by spending money and giving to their campaign contributors, their campaign contributors can then help them back.  You're looking at the nations money, and you can either save it for the good of taxpayers, or you could siphon some of it off for yourself.  If you're in politics for your nation, you do the right thing for the taxpayers.  But most politicians 'it seems' are out for themselves and want to bleed the nation dry for their personal benefit.  Are people merely blind to this?  Or do we actually believe them when they claim Keynes?

At the current rate, the US may self destruct because of debt.  As you get deeper and deeper into debt, you pay more tax payer dollars into interest.  This means for every dollar taxed, the government can do less things with it.  Eventually you might not even pay off the interest with your income.  Also we're riding in a danger zone.  

I think the solution is for the government to have a balanced budget amendment done right.  If you just say: The budget must be balanced except for wars.  Then what happens is you have irresponsible politicians declaring war for their own pocket books.  We should not have encouragement to go to war in law!  Also there are many reasons why you might want to go into debt other than war.  So this is why I propose a soft balanced budget amendment.

Soft Balanced budget amendment goes like this:
In years where Congress passes a balanced budget, Congress and the President get double their salary.  The beauty of this is even if they're self serving and not out for the country's best interest, this law helps them make decisions in the country's best interest.   100 million is a drop in the bucket when it comes to the numbers the budget addresses.",0,0.5

323,2011-08-07,Don't know how to title... please critique,"Okay, so I've tried to type this up several times, but haven't been satisfied with the delivery. This attempt will have to suffice.

I am not well versed in economics. I do, however, want to put forth my own ideas regarding debt, in hopes to gain a better grasp over the concepts at work in the modern global economy.

I am, as my ideas may betray, a citizen of the United States of America. I have been taught fiscal responsibility from my parents, and I have a deep seated aversion to accruing any lasting debt. Ironically, reality has pushed my parents deep into debt, despite their own typically frugal lifestyles. Thankfully, the debt of my parents pales exponentially compared to what is rapidly becoming the norm, at least as I understand it.

What I have been brought up to believe is that any major purchase should be preceded by a reasonable savings venture. I do not mean that you should only purchase those things which you are immediately able to pay for completely, only that you should have a reasonable and measured approach to spending. Also, any debt you do incur should be a major factor in all future monetary decisions, so long as it exists.

>In other words, if I wish to purchase a car for $17,000.00, and I have a down payment of $7,000.00, I would be financing $10,000.00 over the course of about five years. Accounting for an interest rate of 10%, the car loan would cost me about $215 per month. This means, that for the next five years, my income is effectively $215 less than it would otherwise be.

To me, this is a very reasonable view, and prevents someone from purchasing a $17,000.00 dollar car with the same loan information just hypothetically put forward when they bring home an income of only $200 per month (after accounting for living accommodations, sustenance, and other necessities).

However, if the same person, with this supposed $200.00 discretionary income per month, were to be interested in the $17,000.00 car, they would still be able to purchase the car after they had saved up sufficient money to reduce the loan amount. This just means exercising self control and patience. Otherwise, this person would, by necessity, have to purchase an alternative vehicle, or none at all.

The part of this example that seems to baffle me arises from companies which extend you credit, for increased interest rates. Suppose the person wishing to purchase the $17,000.00 car has the $7,000.00 down payment, plus a $2,000.00 credit limit on a shiny new credit card. The total debt, should this person change their down payment to $9,000.00 (by using their new credit card), would still be the same figure of $10,000.00 plus interest. So, the problem of affordability has not changed for this person. But, the car loan and credit card payments, individually, are manageable. So, when this person makes this decision to utilize their savings for the down payment augmented by a line of credit, they may believe they have things under control, but in reality, they do not. Why, then, are they allowed to make such decisions? The very same idea applies to sub-prime mortgages. I simply do not understand why there are no safeguards. The purchase may go through, but there will eventually be foreclosures, repossessions, injunctions, shattered hopes, dreams, and families.

Now, extrapolate these ideas to the federal level. Why is it not inherent in our government to make responsible decisions? All things must be paid for eventually. I am not necessarily advocating a balanced budget. I am not educated enough in economics to take such a position. I am, however, advocating responsible repayment of financial obligations and an aversion to irresponsible assumption of additional debt which may lead to a federal level ""shattered family"".",0,0.5

Neoliberalism is a market based theory of economic and social policy, loosely based on neoclassical economics, that has become increasingly influential since the early 1970s.  The role of the state is minimised, with a corresponding increase in the role of the private sector in determining the political and economic priorities of the state, through the efficiency of private enterprise, liberalised trade and relatively open markets.  Neoliberalism also places a heavy emphasis on individuals (citizens) producing and increasing their own productivity and wealth.",4,0.67
363,2011-08-30,"""Gold's price predicts inflation"". Ha. If this recession has exploded any myth at all, it has to be that one!","Price of gold over the last 36 months: From $780 to $1,800, up 130%.

[Rise in the CPI](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/CPIAUCSL.txt) over the last 36 months:  From 219.133 to 225.425, up all of 2.87% total, 0.95% annually.

The market's current expectation of inflation over the next two years: [0.88%](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=USGGBE02:IND).

Over the next *ten years*: [1.63%](http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/data/inflation_expectations/index.cfm).

So we can say for dang sure that it *ain't* been either inflation or fear of it in the market that's been pushing up the price of gold!

What has been doing it?  

Well, the heart of the gold market is Asia, so maybe inflation fears in China or events in India are doing it -- the USA actually isn't the sole cause of everything that happens in the world -- but let's put that aside for the monent. 

As to American investors, the answer is pretty clear: *the price of gold moves sharply inverse to the real interest rate*. 

The reason for this should be clear -- gold pays no interest, so investing in gold normally is costly in terms of interest lost from other potential investments, but as the interest rate falls this cost of investing in gold declines, so gold becomes more valuable.

This effect can be quite dramatic. As a numeric example, say an amount X of gold has a price of $1,000 and so does a perpetual bond, such as a consul, paying 3% interest, $30 per year forever.  Now let's say the market interest rate drops from 3% to 1%.  Some very simple math (or a bond price calculator) tells us the price of the bond  *triples* to $3,000.  (price = $30/1%)  At the same time the opportunity cost of holding gold drops 67%. Do we see direction that the price of the X amount of gold moves in?

But in real life it hasn't stopped there. Real interest rates recently have become *negative*, so investing in gold actually *saves money* compared to the alternative -- what affect does that have on the price of gold?

OK, if the price of gold actually moves inversely to the real interest rate, where does the folk belief that it predicts future inflation come from? 

Well, historically, low real interest rates have caused future inflation -- negative real rates certainly did that leading up to gold's real all-time high price in 1980. So in the past the price of gold has effectively predicted inflation, even though it didn't do it literally.  Today we see the difference.

I have never heard of a country with a progressive scale tax. 

I have friends who hate the government because the government picks ""winners"" to pay less tax.  Those with kids,  those who are married,  those who own houses instead of rent.  This unfairly punishes those who like being single or those who dont want to live by the governments set rules.  I understand why they would be pissed. 

I dont believe a progressive flat tax would be too unreasonable in fact even be something the republicans seem to be claiming to support ( well a progressive tax that curves down towards the super rich ).  It would be progressive on all money earned so that you dont get into a situation where you make 1 extra dollar and get bumped up into a higher bracket.

It should scale based on income % so that you don't have to keep raising the amounts and hopefully mathematically modeled to find the perfect balance ( i am sure someone has done this ).

The politics would be around the percentage paid and the tiers but i think everyone (reasonable) agrees the rich should pay ""more percentage"" but right now they pay less.  

Personally i would like to see it cap out at the top .001% of income  paying 50% ( or more ),  with those who make in the bottom 25% pay 0 tax and then using an exponential curve raise the rates from there. 

The tax would be on all income made in anyway no exceptions or deductions for people to abuse.

Inspired by my previous reddit submission [How Money Got Weird](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/kxokm/how_money_got_weird/)

**355**: [The Giant Pool of Money](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money).  A special program about the housing crisis produced in a special collaboration with NPR News. We explain it all to you. What does the housing crisis have to do with the turmoil on Wall Street? Why did banks make half-million dollar loans to people without jobs or income? And why is everyone talking so much about the 1930s?

**365**: [Another Frightening Show about the Economy](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/365/another-frightening-show-about-the-economy) Alex Blumberg and NPR's Adam Davidson—the two guys who reported our Giant Pool of Money episode—are back, in collaboration with the Planet Money podcast.

**375**: [Bad Bank](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/375/bad-bank) The collapse of the banking system explained, in just 59 minutes.

**377**: [Scenes from a Recession](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/377/scenes-from-a-recession) The economy works in mysterious ways. This week, we highlight the unusual circumstances our economic drought has left us in, and the newly hatched plans being made to survive it.

**390**: [Return to the Giant Pool of Money](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/390/return-to-the-giant-pool-of-money) In which we mark the anniversary of the economic collapse and the anniversary of Planet Money: Recapping some of the original episode, The Giant Pool of Money, and finding out what's happened to all those guys in the year since.

**405**: [Inside Job](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/405/inside-job) For seven months a team of investigative journalists from ProPublica looked into a story for us, the inside story of one company that made hundreds of millions of dollars for itself while worsening the financial crisis for the rest of us.

If you enjoyed those episodes of This American Life, the [Planet Money Podcast](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/) team continues to bring great economic news each week.

412,2011-10-16,I am a Democrat who supports FairTax. Here's why.,"For people who don't know what FairTax is:

FairTax is a 23% federal retail sales tax collected at the final point of purchase of new goods and services for personal consumption. This REPLACES all federal income taxes, as well as payroll taxes (SS/medicare), capital gains tax, alternative minimum tax, self-employment tax, estate tax, and gift tax. No more individual tax filings, no more IRS (collection is state-adminstered), no more lobbying for exemptions and deductions, no more loopholes.

Since lower-income people spend proportionally more on necessities, a ""prebate"" is paid in advance to everyone equivalent to the amount of taxes one would pay at the poverty line. For example, the 2011 poverty line is $10,890 per adult plus $3,820 per child. Therefore, two adults with 0 kids would receive (10,890+10,890)x23% = $5,009/yr, or $417/mo. The more you spend, the less helpful the prebate is to you. If the couple spends $20k, $50k or $100k that year, their *effective* tax rates would be -2%, 13% and 18%, respectively. This makes the [distribution of the FairTax burden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_the_FairTax_burden) surprisingly progressive.

In addition, all existing government programs like welfare, unemployment, social security, and medicare are still there. Under the current system, because benefits are capped, FICA taxes only apply to the first $107k of income. Under FairTax, rich people are effectively taxed for these programs on the *entirety* of their consumption, despite the limited benefit these programs provide for them personally.

The 23% rate was specifically chosen because it: (1) raises the same amount of federal funds as are raised by the current system, (2) covers the universal rebate, and (3) covers the collection fees to retailers and state governments.

**WHY I SUPPORT IT**

The overall effect is that pretty much EVERYONE pays less in taxes. This is because the tax base is now MUCH larger. The underground black market in the US is estimated at $1-3 trillion. Drug dealers, illegal immigrants, and anyone else making money illegally would now be taxed upon consumption. Spending by tourists and government is also now taxed, as are foreign imports. Consumption is also more stable than income, resulting in a more stable source of revenue for government and reducing our susceptibility to unexpected debt problems.

Hundreds of billions of dollars are saved in adminstrative overhead. The number of tax filers is reduced 86%, and filing complexity is reduced to a simple sales tax form. 60,000 pages of tax codes and laws are reduced to something you can read in a day. The elimination of tax deduction incentives, coupled with the transparency of a simple tax code, would significantly reduce lobbyist influence in federal politics. The neutrality of FairTax would eliminate social and economic inequalities in our tax code. The high visibility of the tax would also put pressure on the fed to control spending (arguably this is causing political opposition to FairTax).

Currently every level of the supply chain is taxed -- the research firm, raw material supplier, manufacturing company, wholesaler, retailer -- all of which adds to the final sale price. With FairTax, all intermediate business transactions are tax-free until the final point of purchase. The intermediate savings will help offset the added cost of the tax in the final sale price. Also, don't forget that without income/payroll taxes, consumers have more to spend.

FairTax would also help reverse our trade deficit and create jobs. Right now, due to US tax policy, foreign companies have a 17% competitive advantage. Even US-based companies have significantly outsourced operations just to avoid our income taxes. Under FairTax, there is no avoiding taxes if you want to sell to US consumers. This also puts domestic products and foreign imports on an even playing field. Conversely, if something is made in the US and sold overseas, there would be no federal taxes whatsoever. As a result, operations and jobs would rush back into the US and exports would be far more competitively priced internationally, helping reduce unemployment and rebuild the ""Made in USA"" brand. Also, since there would no longer be any tax benefit in holding money in offshore accounts, that money would be transferred back into US capital markets and put to work.

Under FairTax, used goods are tax-free. The premium for new products would encourage people to invest in durability and reduce wasteful spending, reversing some of the environmental consequences of consumerism. The tax-free secondary market will not kill the market for new goods because supply and demand would eventually equalize the relative price differences. For example, since only new homes are taxed, they would initially be priced higher. The demand for new homes would then drop and existing homes would rise until a price equilibrium is reached. Eventually, the price of used homes would rise to indirectly include the tax originally paid when it was new. This applies to all reusable goods.

It sounds almost too simple, but FairTax is one of the most thoroughly researched albeit untested tax reform plans in the world. Detailed analyses and economic simulations have been performed to evaluate the [predicted effects of FairTax on our economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicted_effects_of_the_FairTax).

468,2011-12-05,"This is my limited understanding of the financial crisis, is it more or less correct?","Over decades, banks started giving out credit cards and mortgages to people who probably shouldn't have been given them. Using this borrowed money, however, people bought lots of stuff, big things too, like cars, homes, and college tuition. 

But as the actual wages of most people stayed the same, or fell, over a period of time, those people couldn't really afford to pay back this borrowed money, and those college degrees didn't always equate to high-paying jobs in the future. 

Wall Street trading groups would gather up these amounts owed, combine them into giant chunks of debt, and then sell speculative bids on whether or not these debts would be paid back with interest. Sometimes executives at companies selling these speculations knew the debts would likely fail, but continued to sell them to as financial assets to others. 

Eventually people started to realize these debts weren't going to be repaid, some already not being repaid, and price started to collapse. Because of the nature of financial trading, it happened all over the world. Financial assets were drastically devalued. Stocks plunged. Credit lines were stopped. Workers were laid-off.

Since many of the largest banks in America were the ones playing with the credit cards, mortgages, student loans, and other financial assets - it was thought that they might collapse, potentially crippling the global economy further. 

So, rather than letting those banks fail and have consumers be repaid by FDIC insurance, Congress, both President Bush and President Obama, along with the Federal Reserve, gave banks both domestic and foreign trillions in currency to stay afloat.

Meanwhile, top executives at banks and Wall Street trading companies collected millions and millions in bonus money for themselves, raised penalties on late customers, sold off debt to gigantic collective agencies at factions on the dollar, and foreclosed on homes across the nation.

The economy is still dead, unemployment remains at a steady high, but most of the banks eventually paid back the funds loaned to them by the federal government at what was basically a 0% interest rate, there are now more ""too big to fail"" institutions, students still owe a combined $1 trillion to private companies and public agencies, and over 20% of mortgages in this country are underwater.

I asked a [question](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ndpke/could_someone_please_explain_the_consumer_goods/) in /r/europe about why prices for so many consumer goods and services generally seem to be higher than in the U.S.  Here's the original:

> Over the past 16 years since moving back from the US, I've noticed that run-of-the-mill consumer articles (clothes, electronics, auto parts, tools, etc.) - as opposed to luxury (stuff like brand purses) or specialist items, are regularly priced much, much higher in Western Europe than their equivalents in the U.S.

> **Beware**:  totally anecdotal experience and unsystematic, random research.  Possible misconceptions or wrong information, feel free to correct me.

> For example, today I tried to buy a small camera replacement battery. A 5-pack of these costs ca. US $5 on amazon.com, plus $3 shipping.

> Amazon.fr sells this for €4, with shipping. Amazon.de sells a single battery for €5, with shipping. A specialty camera shop in Germany sells it for €13 (!). A top quality Cree LED torch I recently ordered from China came for $25. I've seen the same thing in shops in the Netherlands, France and Germany for 3-4 times that amount, online, and even more than that retail!

> The same goes for computer monitors, clothes, cameras, and pretty much anything ""routine"" I've bought recently.
So I spent a few minutes looking at examples - this is totally unscientific and the result of a few bored minutes putzing around Amazon and other online merchants in various countries, as well as my own experience.

> Cars: a new base model BMW 335i in Germany (since they're made there) starts at ca. €36k before tax. The same car in the US starts at $42k - fully €4k less. And let's not start with iTunes, Steam games, and other digital content that in no way incurs any different manufacturing, handling, or shipping costs for us Europeans than the Americans. Another random one: vitamine C supplements - ca. $15 for 500 capsules in the US, ca, £15 for half that in the UK, around €15 for a fifth of the US amount in France.

> In fairness, I've noted a drop in online retail computer component prices in the past five years, to the point that some products are priced about the same. But these seem to be exceptions. For every example of ""costs as much or more in the US"", I'll find you five examples to the contrary.

> 15-25% VAT (as opposed to US state/local sales taxes from 4-10%) does not explain this massive price differential, nor does shipping - most of this stuff is made in Asia. European salaries are not, on the whole, that much higher than American ones (according to wikipedia, the US is actually in second place for median household income worldwide).

> I understand that a place like Switzerland would have a high Big Mac Index position - it's always been expensive, still suffers from stupid customs rules and weird regulations, has high salaries and a culture that historically equates expensive with ""good"", and still has fairly limited competition in a lot of areas. But why would this be the same for, for example, a pair of Levi's in the UK, which are up to 50% cheaper in the US?

> It can't be because of regulation - the Americans are easily on a par with the worst the EU can come up with in things like environmental and product safety restrictions. So that can't be adding extra cost. And in the EU's defense, they have agreed on a lot of standardization, like for power plugs, so the cost of adaptation to local markets also can't explain it (not to mention removal of customs borders and the common currency, while it lasts). Nor rent and such overhead - shops in American city centers face occasionally even higher rent costs than those in any random European city outside of maybe Paris, London, Zurich, Munich, etc. It's also not market size - while European countries are of course smaller than the US as a whole, you're not going to gain that much economy of scale from selling to 300 million people as opposed to, say, 80 million Germans or 65 million French.

> The only possible theory I can come up with is increased labor costs due to social contributions that employers have to pay, but that by itself can't be driving up prices so much.

> So, what the fuck? Is this just ""fuck you because we can"" price gouging by merchants, along the lines of what our friends in Australia experience?

How Better Research Design Is Taking the Con
out of Econometrics](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.2.3)

I nominated this one! Here's what I said:

> I was at a conference a few days ago, and one of the paper discussants (jokingly) lambasted Esther Duflo for having made the role of a discussant much harder. 20 years ago, all the discussant had to do was suggest that maybe the paper's identification strategy was invalid. Since virtually all papers had poor identification strategies, this was pretty easy. Nowadays the discussant has to read the paper!

> ""Credibility Revolution"" is a response to Ed Learner's [Let Take The Con Out of Econometrics](http://www.international.ucla.edu/media/files/Leamer_article.pdf), a 1983 critique of methods in empirical economics. The paper is a potted history of how new empirical methods, especially in terms of research design (including the use of instrumental variables, regression discontinuities, natural experiments, and randomized controlled trials) have increasingly become standard practice within empirical microeconomics - and are being to make inroads into macro.

> Here's the abstract from the NBER working paper version:

> > This essay reviews progress in empirical economics since Leamer’s (1983) critique. Leamer highlighted
the benefits of sensitivity analysis, a procedure in which researchers show how their results change
with changes in specification or functional form. Sensitivity analysis has had a salutary but not a revolutionary
effect on econometric practice. As we see it, the credibility revolution in empirical work can be traced
to the rise of a design-based approach that emphasizes the identification of causal effects. Design-based
studies typically feature either real or natural experiments and are distinguished by their prima facie
credibility and by the attention investigators devote to making the case for a causal interpretation of
the findings their designs generate. Design-based studies are most often found in the microeconomic
fields of Development, Education, Environment, Labor, Health, and Public Finance, but are still rare
in Industrial Organization and Macroeconomics. We explain why IO and Macro would do well to
embrace a design-based approach. Finally, we respond to the charge that the design-based revolution
has overreached.

This week's article comes from /u/paulkuhn, who writes:

> [The current article of the week on liquidity traps](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/26g0n6/article_of_the_week_escaping_from_a_liquidity/) reminded me of Krugman's 1998 paper, It's Baaack: Japan's Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap[1] . From my (incomplete) understanding it revived the discussion of liquidity traps from a very long hiatus, and as an added plus, it has some current relevance.

This week's article was nominated by /u/sheer, who writes:

> He discusses the deadweight losses associated with migration restrictions. It's nothing revolutionary necessarily (except maybe the magnitude of the possible gains), but he elegantly explains/summarizes a topic that seems to have received little attention from professional economists. This is also readable for those who haven't taken graduate level economics.

Abstract:

> What is the greatest single class of distortions in the global economy? One contender for this title is the tightly binding constraints on emigration from poor countries. Vast numbers of people in low-income countries want to emigrate from those countries but cannot. How large are the economic losses caused by barriers to emigration? Research on this question has been distinguished by its rarity and obscurity, but the few estimates we have should make economists' jaws hit their desks. The gains to eliminating migration barriers amount to large fractions of world GDP—one or two orders of magnitude larger than the gains from dropping all remaining restrictions on international flows of goods and capital. When it comes to policies that restrict emigration, there appear to be trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk.

This week's article comes from /u/Petrocrat, who writes:

> HP Minsky explains why the quantity theory of money and exogenous control of the quantity is inaccurate through an overview of previous theorists such as N. Kaldor and JM Keynes. The alternative understanding of money and the supply of money is explained to be endogneous (and non-neutral) within a capitalist financial system such as that in the USA.

> Minsky discusses various types of money and how those types are introduced into the financial system by the economic activity of entrepreneurs, bankers and money managers. He also discusses how the activities of those private sector agents is what actually determines the quantity of money, thus the moniker ""endogenous money.""",24,0.77

1393,2015-02-24,Looking for more mods,"You guys might remember that we ran a survey at the beginning of the year. We've done a quick cursory look at the data, and there were two things that struck us:

1.) Most people seemed to be more-or-less in favor of our basic mod philosophy, but thought it could be more consistently applied.
2.) A thorough analysis of the survey would take a couple of hours, and none of us were able to put the time together.

In other words, we need more moderators!

What do moderators do?

* Mostly, boring stuff. Answering questions in modmail. Pulling off-topic posts. Asking people to not call each other Nazis.

* Some cool projects to make the subreddit a better place. Article of the Week, Bureau Members, and the RSS feeds^1 are recent endeavors. We still need more hands on deck to do stuff like create a FAQ or wiki. And we're interested in any ideas that new moderators (or community members in general!) bring to the table.

What are we looking for?

1,) Interest in economics and decent background (college major in Economics as the floor). We're not looking for subject matter experts^2, just a passion for the subject, and an ability to distinguish links that are good for /r/economics from those that really should be in /r/politics, /r/investing, or /r/business. 

2.) History of well-written comments in the /r/economics subreddit, and general mature behavior in reddit as a whole. That doesn't mean that you can't be a fan of memes or circlejerks, more that you don't have a history of trolling.

3.) We are especially interested in people who are A.) located in Asia or Australia (since most of the current team is, I believe, US and Europe based) B.) Have experience modding large and/or active subreddits C.) Have programming/css skills to help out with some of underlying systems.

Please leave a comment in this thread if you are interested! Let us know you economics background, how much time you spend on /r/economics, ideas for cool projects, and anything else that might help us better evaluate your fit.

***

1 - By the way, the reddit admins have shadowblocked the feeds. We're trying to get the re-instated, but if anyone from the community wants to reach out to the admins, that would be appreciated.

2 - We generally think of the moderators as serving a different purpose than the Bureau Members, and so far have a policy of not flairing the mods (to prevent accusations of bias). Bureau members are welcome to apply, but will probably lose their flair.",20,0.77

**ABSTRACT**

***

Large numbers of people born in poor countries would like to leave those countries, but barriers
prevent their emigration. Those barriers, according to economists’ best estimates to date, cost the
world economy much more than all remaining barriers to the international movement of goods
and capital combined. Yet economists spend much more time studying the movement of goods and capital, and when they study migration at all, they focus on the effects of immigration on nonmigrants in destination countries. 

I ask why this is the case and sketch a four-point research agenda on the effects of emigration. Barriers to emigration deserve a research priority that is commensurate with their likely colossal economic effects.",60,0.9
