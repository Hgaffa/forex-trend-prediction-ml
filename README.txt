C310 Software Documentation
----------------------------

The code for this project is split into two directories. The "Research Notebook" directory contains 10 research jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
that outline the main findings and algorithms explained within the report. These notebooks contain results from over 45 individual 
notebooks that were compressed to highlight critical information. To run them you can either open them in an editor
such as VScode and install supporting packages for local jupyter servers or spin up a server and manually open the files
via the "python jupyter notebook" command. There are also several csv datafiles within the notebook folder, these are used and
generated by the jupyter notebooks and can be changed to any compatible dataset. Its also important to note that all required libraries
are documented at the top of each notebook. These libraries are ubiquitous for both software submissions.

The second part of the submitted software solution is the machine learning and data analysis dashboard. This is a tangible
system that can be interacted with to follow the processes explained in the report. To acces this system, simply enter the
"Machine Learning Dashboard" folder and run the following command "py ./main.py". This will open up the user interface in which
you are free to interact however you like. I would suggest following the steps outlined in the report chronologically to avoid bugs
and first installing the libraries detailed in the notebooks. A video demonstration has also been provided in this folder to 
show how the system is intended to be used. The system can take any compatible historic dataset as input, however, there is no 
functionality for live sentiment and fundamental analysis. This is because the scraping period takes too long to feasibly
enforce live. Moreover, the AUD/USD dataset can be found in the "Machine Learning Dashboard/Data" folder which was used for the
project presentation and as an exemplar dataset. Similarly, a set of pre-scraped new headlines and social media posts are also
provided for this data. 

Note: The dashboard may exhibit slow behaviour as training and evaluating machine learning models takes a considerable amount of time.
      Therefore, please wait when evaluating a model for the visualisations and metrics to appear.  

All the best,
